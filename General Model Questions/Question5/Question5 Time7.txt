Assistant: Certainly! At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, both research projects and thesis options are available for students to fulfill their research/thesis credit requirements. Each option has distinct components and milestones. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Research Project Option

Overview:  
The research project is typically less extensive than a thesis and focuses on practical application within the field of study.

Key Milestones:

1. Project Proposal:  
Develop a clear proposal outlining the scope, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
Obtain approval from your faculty advisor or graduate coordinator.

2. Research & Analysis:  
Conduct research according to the approved plan.
Analyze data using appropriate methods relevant to your field.

3. Written Report:  
Compile your findings into a comprehensive report.
Ensure clarity, coherence, and adherence to academic standards in writing.

4. Defense of Project (DEFN):  
Present and defend your project findings before a committee.
Respond to questions and demonstrate mastery of your topic.

5. Final Project Completion (PROJ):  
Incorporate feedback from the defense into the final report if necessary.
Submit the finalized project document by the deadline specified by your department.

Thesis Option

Overview:  
A thesis involves more in-depth research than a project and contributes original knowledge or insights to the field.

Key Milestones:

1. Thesis Proposal:  
Write a detailed proposal including literature review, hypothesis or research questions, methodology, and timeline.
Gain approval from your thesis committee.

2. Research & Data Collection:  
Conduct extensive research following rigorous academic methodologies.
Collect and analyze data comprehensively.

3. Draft Thesis Submission (DRAT):  
Prepare an initial draft of your thesis document adhering to format guidelines provided by the Graduate School.
   
4. Format Approval Sheet (FORM):  
Submit this sheet along with your draft for format compliance verification by the Graduate School.

5. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN):  
Defend your thesis in an oral examination before a committee of faculty members.
Demonstrate thorough understanding and justify conclusions drawn from your work.

6. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO):
Pass an additional oral exam covering broader aspects related to your field as required by some programs.

7. Final Thesis Submission (THES) & Signed Title Page (TITL):
Revise based on defense feedback and submit the final version electronically along with signed title page by set deadlines.
    
8. ETD Submission Form (ETDF):
Complete this electronic form submission with final documentation as part of official graduation requirements.

Conclusion
Both options require significant planning, execution, and presentation skills but differ mainly in depth and scope of research involved.
