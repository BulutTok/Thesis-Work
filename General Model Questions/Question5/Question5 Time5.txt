Assistant: Certainly! At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, graduate students can fulfill their research/thesis credit requirement through either a research project or a thesis. Both options involve significant research and contribute to the completion of your degree, but they differ in focus, scope, and format.

Research Project Option

Overview:
The research project is typically applied and practical in nature. It involves solving a specific problem using established methods.
This option often suits students aiming for industry roles where practical application of skills is emphasized.

Key Milestones:
1. Project Proposal: Develop a detailed proposal outlining the problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
2. Conduct Research: Implement the project plan by collecting data, analyzing it, and deriving conclusions or solutions.
3. Final Project Completion (PROJ): Complete all elements of the project and compile findings into a comprehensive report.
4. Defense (DEFN): Present and defend your project before a faculty committee to demonstrate its validity and significance.

Thesis Option

Overview:
A thesis involves conducting original research that contributes new knowledge or insights to the field.
It is more extensive than a research project and requires adherence to academic standards for documentation.

Key Milestones:
1. Draft Thesis (DRAT): Prepare an initial draft of your thesis for review by your advisor or committee.
2. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Obtain approval for the format of your draft thesis from the Graduate School to ensure compliance with guidelines.
3. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral exam covering coursework relevant to your thesis topic.
4. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN): Defend your thesis in front of an academic committee who evaluates its originality and scholarly contribution.
5. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Submit the revised final version electronically by the deadline set by the Graduate School.
6. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL) & ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Include these forms with your final submission as part of official requirements.

Summary
The research project focuses on applying existing knowledge practically with less emphasis on theoretical contributions compared to a thesis.
The thesis demands rigorous investigation into new areas or expansion of existing theories with strict adherence to scholarly formats.

Choosing between these paths should align with your career goals—whether you aim for practical industry applications or academic/research-oriented careers—and consulting with your advisor can provide further personalized guidance based on individual strengths and aspirations.
