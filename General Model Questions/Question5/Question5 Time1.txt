Assistant: Certainly! Both the research project and thesis options are designed to fulfill the research/thesis credit requirements for your degree, but they differ in scope, depth, and some of the key milestones involved. Here’s a breakdown:

Research Project

Purpose:
The research project is typically more applied in nature. It involves a focused study on a specific topic within computer science or information systems, under faculty supervision.

Key Milestones:
1. Project Proposal: Develop a proposal outlining the objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes of your project.
2. Research and Implementation: Conduct the research as per the proposal, implement solutions or models if applicable.
3. Final Project Report: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing your findings and analyses.
4. Defense of Project (DEFN): Successfully defend your project before a committee.
5. Completion (PROJ): Achieve final approval upon successful defense and submission of all required documentation.

Thesis

Purpose:
A thesis is generally more theoretical or exploratory and involves original research contributing new knowledge to the field.

Key Milestones:
1. Draft Thesis (DRAT): Submit an initial draft of your thesis for feedback.
2. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral exam covering broad topics related to your field of study.
3. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN): Defend your thesis in front of a committee to demonstrate mastery over your research area.
4. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Submit this sheet with the draft thesis for format verification by the Graduate School.
5. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Submit the finalized version of your thesis electronically by the deadline.
6. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL) & ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Ensure these forms are submitted along with your final thesis.

Summary
The research project is often shorter and more practical, focusing on applying existing knowledge to solve specific problems.
The thesis requires deeper investigation into theoretical aspects or novel contributions to academia.

Both options require rigorous work and culminate in a defense presentation, but they cater to different career goals—research projects may be better suited for those heading into industry roles where application is key, while theses are ideal for those considering further academic pursuits like Ph.Ds.
