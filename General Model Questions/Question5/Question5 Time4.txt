Assistant: Certainly! At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, graduate students have the option to complete their research/thesis credit requirement through either a research project or a thesis. Both options are designed to demonstrate a student’s ability to conduct independent research, but they differ in scope, depth, and format.

Research Project Option

Overview:
The research project is typically applied in nature, focusing on solving a practical problem using existing knowledge and techniques.
It is generally shorter and less formal than a thesis.

Key Milestones:
1. Project Proposal: Develop and submit a proposal that outlines the problem statement, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes.
2. Conduct Research: Execute the project plan by gathering data, analyzing it, and developing solutions or insights.
3. Final Project Completion (PROJ): Complete all aspects of the project including writing up your findings in a report format.
4. Defense (DEFN): Present and defend your findings before a faculty committee to demonstrate understanding and application of the research topic.

Thesis Option

Overview:
A thesis involves original research that contributes new knowledge or insights to the field.
It is more comprehensive than a research project and requires formal documentation following academic standards.

Key Milestones:
1. Draft Thesis (DRAT): Prepare an initial draft of your thesis document for feedback from your advisor or committee.
2. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Submit your draft for format approval to ensure it meets Graduate School requirements.
3. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral examination that tests your understanding of coursework related to your thesis topic.
4. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN): Defend your thesis before an academic committee who will evaluate its originality and contribution to the field.
5. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Revise based on defense feedback and submit the final version electronically by the Graduate School's deadline.
6. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL) & ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Include these forms with your final submission as part of official documentation requirements.

Summary
The research project focuses on applying theoretical knowledge practically with less emphasis on creating new theories or concepts compared to a thesis.
The thesis demands more rigorous investigation into new areas or expansion of existing knowledge with strict adherence to scholarly formats.

Choosing between these options should align with your career goals—whether you aim for practical industry application or academic/research-oriented careers—and discussing this choice with your advisor can provide further personalized guidance based on individual strengths and aspirations.
