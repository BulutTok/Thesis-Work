Assistant: Certainly! At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, students pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science & Information Systems have the option to fulfill their research or thesis credit requirements through either a Research Project or a Thesis. Here’s a breakdown of each option and the key milestones associated with them:

Research Project

Description:
The research project involves focused study on a practical application of computer science or information systems under faculty guidance. Students select topics approved by faculty and the graduate coordinator.
  
Key Milestones:
1. Topic Selection: Choose a research topic with faculty approval.
2. Project Development: Develop your project, which includes planning, executing, and analyzing results.
3. Written Analysis and Oral Presentation: Prepare a comprehensive written analysis and present your findings orally.
4. Defense of Project (DEFN): Successfully defend your research project in front of a committee.
5. Final Project Completion (PROJ): Ensure all project components are completed as per guidelines.

Thesis

Description:
A thesis is an intensive research study on a selected topic that requires approval by a thesis committee. It involves original research contributing new knowledge or understanding to the field.

Key Milestones:
1. Draft Thesis Submission (DRAT): Submit an initial draft electronically to the Graduate School by the deadline.
2. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Submit this form along with your draft for format approval.
3. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral exam testing comprehensive knowledge related to your thesis topic.
4. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN): Defend your thesis before a committee successfully.
5. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Submit the final version of your thesis electronically by the deadline.
6. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL) & ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Provide these documents with your final submission.

Summary
The Research Project is more practice-oriented, focusing on applying theoretical concepts to real-world problems, while the Thesis is more academically rigorous, involving original research that contributes to scholarly literature.
Both paths require substantial preparation and culminate in formal presentations or defenses before academic committees.

Choosing between these options often depends on career goals—whether you are aiming for industry positions where practical experience is valued, or academia/research roles where contributions to scholarly work are critical.

If you have any further questions about choosing between these options or need help planning out these milestones, I recommend consulting directly with your primary advisor or visiting [UNCW's Graduate School Forms](https://uncw.edu/myuncw/academics/graduate-school/forms) page for detailed instructions and necessary forms related to each requirement path.
