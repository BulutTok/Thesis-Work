Assistant: Certainly! Understanding the differences between the research project and thesis options, as well as their respective key milestones, is crucial for planning your academic trajectory. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

Research Project Option

Purpose:
The research project is typically focused on applying theoretical knowledge to a practical problem or case study within the field of Computer Science or Information Systems.

Key Milestones:
1. Research Proposal: Develop and get approval for your research proposal from your advisor.
2. Conduct Research: Implement your project according to the approved plan.
3. Write-Up: Prepare a detailed report documenting your methodology, findings, and analysis.
4. Defense of Project (DEFN): Present and defend your project before a committee.
5. Final Project Completion (PROJ): Successfully complete all aspects of the final project as per guidelines.

Thesis Option

Purpose:
A thesis involves conducting original research that contributes new knowledge or insights to the field. It is more comprehensive than a research project.

Key Milestones:
1. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral exam covering foundational topics in your field.
2. Thesis Proposal: Develop and submit a proposal outlining your intended research.
3. Draft Thesis Submission (DRAT): Submit an initial draft of your thesis for review by deadlines set by the Graduate School.
4. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Ensure that formatting complies with institutional standards and submit the approval sheet along with the draft thesis.
5. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN): Defend your thesis before an academic committee, demonstrating mastery over your topic and its broader implications.
6. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Make necessary revisions post-defense and submit the final version electronically to meet graduation requirements.
7. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL) & ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Submit these documents with your final thesis to complete submission requirements.

Summary
The choice between a research project and a thesis largely depends on whether you are more interested in practical application or contributing original scholarly work to the field:
Choose the Research Project if you prefer hands-on application of existing theories to solve real-world problems in Computer Science/Information Systems.
Opt for the Thesis if you are inclined towards conducting detailed original research that can contribute new insights or discoveries in academia.

Both paths require significant effort but differ in scope, depth, and type of contribution expected from students.

For both options, it's important to work closely with faculty advisors who can provide guidance specific to departmental expectations and assist with navigating through these key milestones effectively.
