Assistant: Understanding Your Full-Time Status as an International Student

I understand your concerns about maintaining your visa status while pursuing your academic goals. Let’s break down the steps you need to follow to ensure you remain a full-time student and meet both academic and immigration requirements.

1. Full-Time Enrollment Requirements

As an international student, it’s essential to maintain full-time enrollment each semester to comply with visa regulations. Here’s what you need to do:
Minimum Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Courses: At least 6 of these credit hours should be from in-person classes.

You can find more details on this [UNCW Full-Time Status page](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

2. Course Prerequisites and Planning

To ensure smooth academic progress, let's consider your current course load and prerequisites:
You are currently enrolled in courses like CSC 532 (Design & Analysis Of Algorithms), MIS 534 (Information Security Management), CSC 550 (Software Engineering), and MIS 503 (Programming for Analytics).
Make sure that any future courses align with prerequisites you've already met or are concurrently completing.

If you have questions about specific prerequisites or want to explore elective options that fit within your program requirements, feel free to ask!

3. Academic Progress and Degree Requirements

Based on the degree audit, here are some key points:
You still need to complete additional core courses such as CSC 544 (Network Programming) and MIS 555 (Database Management Systems).
For research or thesis credits, choose between a research project or thesis option, ensuring you register for the required credits.
  
Ensure all completed courses contribute towards the total of 36 credits needed for graduation.

4. Documentation and Additional Steps

To maintain both academic standing and visa compliance:
Regularly consult with your academic advisor to verify that your course selections keep you on track.
Ensure timely submission of necessary documentation related to enrollment changes or extensions if needed.
