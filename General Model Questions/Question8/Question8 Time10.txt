Assistant: Understanding Full-Time Status and Academic Progress

Step 1: Maintaining Full-Time Status
As an international student, maintaining full-time status is crucial for your visa requirements. At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, you need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester to be considered a full-time graduate student. Additionally, at least 6 of these credit hours must be in-person classes. This ensures compliance with both academic and immigration policies.

For more detailed information about full-time status requirements, please refer to [UNCW's Full-Time Status Policy](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

Step 2: Course Schedule and Prerequisites
Based on your degree audit:
Courses Currently In-Progress (Spring 2025):
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithms I (3 credits)
CSC 550 - Software Engineering (3 credits)
MIS 503 - Programming for Analytics (3 credits)
MIS 534 - Information Security Management (3 credits)

You are currently enrolled in a total of 12 credit hours, which satisfies the requirement for maintaining full-time status.

Step 3: Managing Prerequisites
Ensure that you meet any prerequisites for upcoming courses. For example:
MIS505 requires BAN500 as a prerequisite.
MIS506 requires MIS503 as a prerequisite.
  
If you meet at least one prerequisite for any course requiring multiple prerequisites, you are eligible to enroll in that course.

Additional Steps or Documentation
Continuous Enrollment: If you're not taking courses but still need to finish your capstone or thesis, consider registering for continuous enrollment to maintain your student status. Visit the [Graduate School Forms](https://uncw.edu/myuncw/academics/graduate-school/forms) page for more information.
Consultation with Advisor: Regularly consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're on track academically and meeting all necessary requirements.
  
Summary
Your current enrollment aligns well with both academic progress and visa requirements. Continue monitoring your course load each semester to ensure compliance with full-time status criteria. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional support.

Remember, maintaining communication with both your academic advisor and the international office can help mitigate any potential issues related to your visa status and academic progress.
