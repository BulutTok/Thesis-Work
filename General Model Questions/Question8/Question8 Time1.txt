Assistant: Understanding Your Concerns

I understand that maintaining your visa status while progressing academically can be a challenging balancing act. Let's break down the steps you need to take to ensure you remain in compliance with both academic and immigration requirements.

Full-Time Enrollment Requirements

As an international student, it is crucial to maintain full-time enrollment status. Here’s what you need to know:
Full-Time Status: For graduate students, full-time status typically requires enrollment in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 6 in-person credit hours each semester. This is important for meeting the requirements of your student visa.

You can find more detailed information on maintaining full-time status [here](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

Current Course Schedule

Based on your degree audit:
You are currently enrolled in 12 credit hours, which includes courses like CSC 532, CSC 550, MIS 503, and MIS 534.
Ensure that at least two of these courses have an in-person component to meet the visa requirement.

Prerequisite Management

For certain courses:
Ensure you've met prerequisites or concurrent enrollment conditions. For example:
MIS505 - Data Visualization requires BAN500 concurrently or prior.
  
If you have any questions about specific prerequisites or eligibility for a course due to overlapping criteria (e.g., concurrent enrollment), feel free to reach out for clarification.

Steps and Documentation

1. Monitor Enrollment: Regularly check your enrollment status each semester to ensure you're meeting the minimum required credits.
2. Consult Your Advisor: Regularly meet with your academic advisor to discuss course selections and how they align with both your degree progress and visa requirements.
3. Document Submission: Be sure all necessary documentation related to your visa is submitted timely, including proof of full-time enrollment if requested by immigration authorities.
4. Stay Informed: Keep updated on any changes in immigration policies that might affect student visas through reliable sources or university advisories.

Summary

By ensuring you are enrolled in at least 9 credit hours with a minimum of 6 being in-person each semester, you'll be able to maintain both your academic progress and visa status effectively. Should any issues arise or if further guidance is needed, do not hesitate to contact the international student office or your academic advisor for support.
