Assistant: Understanding Your Full-Time Status and Academic Progress

First, I want to acknowledge that managing academic progress while ensuring compliance with visa requirements can be challenging. Let's break down the steps to help you maintain your full-time student status and meet your academic goals.

1. Full-Time Student Requirements

As an international student, maintaining a full-time course load is crucial for your visa status. According to the guidelines:
You need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
At least 6 of those credit hours must be from in-person classes.

For more detailed information on maintaining full-time status, you can refer to this [UNCW Catalogue page](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

2. Current Course Schedule

Based on your current enrollment, you're taking:
CSC 532: Design & Analysis Of Algorithms I (3 credits)
MIS 534: Information Security Management (3 credits)
CSC 550: Software Engineering (3 credits)
MIS 503: Programming for Analytics (3 credits)

This totals 12 credit hours, which satisfies the requirement for full-time enrollment. Ensure that at least two of these courses are in-person or hybrid formats as required.

3. Prerequisites and Course Planning

Your major requires specific courses and prerequisites:
Ensure you've completed necessary prerequisites for advanced courses.
You have unmet conditions like Network Programming (CSC 544) and Database Management Systems (MIS 555). Plan to enroll in these soon if they fit into your schedule.

4. Documentation and Additional Steps

To ensure compliance with immigration regulations:
Regularly consult with the International Student Services office for guidance on visa-related queries.
Keep track of application deadlines and document submissions required by both UNCW and immigration authorities.
  
If you plan any changes in enrollment, such as dropping a course, immediately consult both your academic advisor and the International Student Services office to understand implications for your visa status.

Summary

You are currently enrolled in enough credit hours to maintain full-time status; just ensure that at least six of those are in-person or hybrid classes. Stay proactive about meeting prerequisites for upcoming courses, and regularly communicate with university services dedicated to supporting international students.
