Assistant: Understanding Your Academic and Immigration Requirements

I understand that balancing academic progress with visa requirements can be a source of concern, especially for international students. Let's go through the steps to ensure you maintain your full-time status and meet your academic goals.

Step 1: Full-Time Enrollment

As an international student, maintaining full-time enrollment is crucial for your visa status. Here's what you need to do:
Enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester. This is typically the minimum required for graduate students to maintain full-time status.
At least 6 of these credit hours should be in-person courses. This is important because online courses alone may not meet the requirements set by immigration regulations.

For more detailed information on maintaining full-time status, please visit [UNCW's Full-Time Status Requirements](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

Step 2: Course Selection and Prerequisites

Based on your degree audit and course data:
You are currently enrolled in:
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithms I
CSC 550 - Software Engineering
MIS 503 - Programming for Analytics
MIS 534 - Information Security Management

These courses total up to 12 credits, which keeps you well above the full-time requirement.
For future semesters, consider prerequisites when planning your schedule:
Ensure you have completed any necessary prerequisites before enrolling in advanced courses.
  
If you meet at least one prerequisite for a course requiring multiple ones, you're eligible to enroll.

Step 3: Additional Documentation
Keep track of any documentation required by both UNCW and immigration authorities.
Regularly check with the university's International Office or your academic advisor to stay updated on any changes or additional requirements.
  
Step 4: Continuous Communication
Stay in touch with both your academic advisor and the International Office at UNCW. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.
  
Summary

By enrolling in at least nine credit hours each semester (with six being in-person), ensuring you meet course prerequisites, and staying informed through regular communication with advisors, you'll be able to maintain both your academic progress and visa status successfully.
