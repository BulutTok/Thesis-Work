Assistant: Understanding Your Concerns

I understand that balancing your academic progress with maintaining visa status can be stressful. Letâ€™s go through the necessary steps to ensure you remain a full-time student, which is essential for maintaining your visa status.

Maintaining Full-Time Status

1. Course Load Requirements:
As an international student, you must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester to maintain full-time status.
At least 6 of these credits should be from in-person courses.

2. Current Enrollment and Prerequisites:
You are currently enrolled in four courses for Spring 2025:
CSC 532 (Design & Analysis Of Algorithms I)
CSC 550 (Software Engineering)
MIS 503 (Programming for Analytics)
MIS 534 (Information Security Management)
Each course carries 3 credit hours, totaling 12 credit hours, which satisfies the full-time requirement.

3. In-Person Requirement:
Ensure that at least two of your current courses are in-person or have face-to-face components. Based on the provided data:
CSC 532 and CSC 550 both have scheduled in-person sessions.

4. Prerequisite Structure:
Review any prerequisites for future courses to plan ahead and ensure you meet all requirements without delay.
For example, MIS 505 requires BAN 500 as a concurrent prerequisite, which you may consider if planning to take that course next semester.

Additional Steps

1. Regular Check-ins with Academic Advisor:
Regularly consult with your academic advisor to stay informed about any changes in course offerings or visa regulations.

2. Documentation:
Keep all necessary documentation updated and readily accessible, such as I-20 forms and proof of enrollment.
   
3. University Resources:
Utilize university resources like the International Student Office for guidance on immigration matters.
  
4. Online Resource:
Refer to this [UNCW Full-Time Status Information](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status) for further details on maintaining your status.

Conclusion
