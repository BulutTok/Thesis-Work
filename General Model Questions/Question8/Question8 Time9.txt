Assistant: Understanding Your Academic and Visa Requirements

I understand that maintaining your visa status while progressing academically is a crucial concern. Let's break down the steps to ensure you meet both academic and immigration requirements.

1. Full-Time Enrollment Requirements
As an international student, it's essential to maintain full-time enrollment to comply with visa regulations. Hereâ€™s what you need to do:
Minimum Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 9 credit hours each semester.
In-Person Classes: At least 6 of these credit hours must be from in-person courses.

For more details on full-time status, please visit [UNCW's Full-Time Status Page](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

2. Course Selection and Prerequisites
From the course data provided:
You are currently enrolled in four courses totaling 12 credits for Spring 2025: CSC 532, CSC 550, MIS 503, and MIS 534.
Ensure you meet the prerequisites for future courses by checking if any of your planned classes have specific prerequisite requirements.

3. Managing Academic Progress
Based on your degree audit:
You need a total of 36 credits to complete your Master of Science degree.
Currently, you've completed or are in progress with 12 credits; thus, you'll need an additional 24 credits.
Maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 for graduation.

4. Documentation and Additional Steps
To maintain compliance with both academic and immigration requirements:
Continuous Enrollment: If you're not taking regular courses but need to finish your capstone or thesis, register for continuous enrollment via [Graduate School Forms](https://uncw.edu/myuncw/academics/graduate-school/forms).
  
Recommendations
1. Plan Ahead: Schedule a meeting with your academic advisor regularly to discuss your course load and ensure it aligns with visa requirements.
2. Track Deadlines: Keep track of important dates such as registration deadlines and graduation applications through SeaNet.
3. Consult International Office: Stay in touch with UNCW's International Student Services for guidance on maintaining your visa status.

Summary
By ensuring you enroll in the required number of credit hours each semester (with at least part being in-person), adhering to prerequisites, tracking academic progress towards completion, and staying informed about immigration guidelines, you'll be well-positioned to maintain both academic success and visa compliance.
