Assistant: Understanding Your Academic and Immigration Requirements

I understand your concerns about maintaining your visa status while managing your academic progress. Let's go through the steps to ensure you remain a full-time student and meet both academic and immigration requirements.

1. Full-Time Enrollment for International Students

As an international student, it's crucial to maintain full-time enrollment each semester to satisfy visa requirements. Here's what you need:
Minimum Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Courses: At least 6 of those credit hours should be from in-person classes.

2. Course Schedule and Prerequisites

Based on the provided course data and your degree audit, here are some recommendations:
Current Courses: You're currently enrolled in courses like CSC 532 (Design & Analysis Of Algorithms I), MIS 534 (Information Security Management), CSC 550 (Software Engineering), and MIS 503 (Programming for Analytics). These courses contribute toward fulfilling your degree requirements.
Prerequisites: Ensure that you meet prerequisites for upcoming courses. For instance, if you're planning to take advanced courses like CSC 544 or MIS 555, check that you've completed necessary prerequisites.

3. Academic Progress

To graduate, you'll need:
A total of 36 credits; currently, you've completed or are enrolled in 12 credits.
To maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0.

You'll also need to complete either a research project or thesis with specific defense and submission requirements.

Advising Sessions: Regularly consult with both your academic advisor and the international student office to stay informed about any changes in policies that might affect your status.
