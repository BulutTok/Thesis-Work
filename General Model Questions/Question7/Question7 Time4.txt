Assistant: To improve your academic standing and meet the minimum 3.0 GPA requirement for your major, consider implementing the following strategies:

1. Evaluate Current Courses and Performance
Review the courses you are currently taking and identify areas where you may be struggling.
Seek feedback from your instructors on how you can improve in these courses.

2. Time Management and Study Skills
Develop a structured study schedule that allows adequate time for each subject.
Use effective study techniques such as active recall, spaced repetition, and summarization to enhance retention.

3. Seek Academic Support
Utilize campus resources such as tutoring centers or academic workshops for additional support.
Join study groups with classmates to gain different perspectives and understanding of course material.

4. Meet with an Academic Advisor
Schedule regular meetings with your academic advisor to discuss your progress and any concerns you have.
They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and academic goals.

5. Consider Course Load Adjustment
If possible, reduce your course load in future semesters to focus more intensely on fewer subjects.
Balance challenging courses with ones that play to your strengths.

6. Improve Specific Skills
Focus on improving skills pertinent to your coursework such as programming (for MIS courses) or critical analysis (for CSC courses).
Take advantage of online resources like tutorials or webinars related to these skills.

7. Retake Courses if Necessary
Consider retaking courses where you've received low grades if allowed by university policy, as improved grades can replace lower ones in GPA calculations.

Summary
Improving your GPA will require a combination of strategic planning, utilization of available resources, and focused effort on enhancing both general academic skills and specific course-related competencies. Regular check-ins with an advisor will help keep you accountable and provide ongoing guidance tailored to your progress.

By addressing these areas methodically, you should be able to improve not only individual course grades but also elevate your overall GPA towards meeting program requirements.
