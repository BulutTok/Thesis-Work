Assistant: Understanding Credit Limitations for Specific Courses

In your program, there is a limitation on the number of credits that can be counted toward your degree from certain types of courses. Specifically, no more than 9 credit hours can be applied from the following courses:
CSC 591 - Directed Independent Study
MIS 591 - Directed Independent Study
CSC 595 - Research Seminar
MIS 595 - Research Seminar
CSC 598 - Internship
MIS 598 - Internship

Why This Limitation Exists

These courses typically involve independent study, research projects, or internships. While these experiences are valuable and provide practical learning opportunities:

1. Breadth of Knowledge: The program aims to ensure that students receive a broad education across various topics within Computer Science and Information Systems.
2. Structured Learning: Core and elective courses often have structured curricula designed to cover essential theories and applications comprehensively.

How This Affects Your Planning

1. Course Selection: If you plan to take any combination of the above courses, ensure that their total does not exceed 9 credit hours if you wish them all to count toward your degree.
   
2. Balancing Coursework: You should also focus on completing required core courses and electives that provide a broader range of knowledge and skills.

3. Strategic Use: Use these limited credit opportunities strategically for areas where hands-on experience or specialized research aligns with your career goals.

Recommendations
Review which of these experiences will most benefit your academic and career objectives.
Discuss with your academic advisor how best to integrate these experiences into your overall course plan without exceeding the limit.
  
Conclusion

By understanding this limitation, you can effectively plan your coursework to meet graduation requirements while gaining valuable hands-on experience through directed studies or internships. Be sure to balance these with other required courses for a comprehensive educational experience in your field.
