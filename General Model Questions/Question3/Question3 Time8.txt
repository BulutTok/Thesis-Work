Assistant: Certainly! In your Master of Science program in Computer Science & Information Systems, there is a limitation on the number of credit hours you can apply from certain types of courses. Specifically:

Explanation:
Directed Independent Study (CSC 591, MIS 591): These courses involve investigation under faculty supervision beyond what is offered in existing courses.
Research Seminar (CSC 595, MIS 595): These courses involve research and discussion of selected topics in computer science or information systems.
Internship (CSC 598, MIS 598): These provide academic training and practical experience through work in a private company or public agency.

Limitation:
You are allowed to apply a maximum of 9 credit hours combined from these course categories toward your degree requirements.

Reasoning:
1. Balance: The program aims to ensure that students receive a balanced education with exposure to both structured coursework and experiential learning.
2. Depth and Breadth: Limiting these credits encourages students to take a variety of courses that provide both depth in specific areas and breadth across the field.
3. Consistency with Program Goals: This ensures alignment with the overall educational goals of the program by emphasizing core knowledge acquisition alongside independent study or practical experiences.

Actionable Steps:
1. Plan your coursework so that you do not exceed this limit if you wish to include any directed independent study, research seminars, or internships as part of your degree plan.
2. Consult with your academic advisor to strategically select these opportunities based on your career goals and interests while staying within the credit hour restrictions.

In summary, while these opportunities are valuable for gaining practical experience and conducting independent research, the restriction ensures that you also complete essential coursework necessary for your degree completion.
