Assistant: Certainly! Here's how the credit hour limitation works for your degree:

Understanding Credit Hour Limitations

1. Course Restrictions:
Courses such as CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 are typically categorized as independent study, research seminar, or internship courses.
These types of courses often involve individualized or experiential learning rather than traditional classroom instruction.

2. Credit Limitation:
You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from this group of courses toward your total degree requirements.
This means that while you can take more than these courses during your program, only up to 9 credits will count towards the completion of the required 36 credit hours for your Master of Science degree.

3. Reasoning Behind Limitation:
The limitation ensures that students gain a balanced education with a mix of structured coursework and independent or practical experience.
It encourages exposure to core subject matter through standard courses alongside personalized learning experiences.

4. Planning Your Coursework:
When planning your coursework, be mindful not to exceed the limit if you want all credits to count toward your degree requirements.
Consider complementing these courses with other required core and elective classes that fit within the program's framework.

Actionable Steps
Review your current course plan and ensure you're on track with both required core classes and electives.
If interested in taking additional independent study or internship opportunities beyond the allowed credits, plan them strategically so they align with personal academic goals but understand they may not all count toward graduation requirements.
Consult with your academic advisor regularly to optimize course selections that best fit within program constraints while meeting career objectives.

Conclusion

This limitation is designed to provide a comprehensive educational experience by combining structured coursework with opportunities for self-directed learning. Make sure to balance these elements effectively throughout your studies.
