Assistant: Certainly! The restriction you mentioned is in place to ensure that students gain a broad and comprehensive understanding of their field by taking a variety of courses, rather than concentrating too heavily on independent study, seminars, or internships.

Explanation

1. Course Categories:
Courses like CSC 591, MIS 591 (Directed Independent Study), CSC 595, MIS 595 (Research Seminar), CSC 598, and MIS 598 (Internship) are generally more specialized or practical in nature.
These courses often involve individual research projects, specialized topics not covered in regular coursework, or practical work experience.

2. Credit Hour Limit:
You can apply up to 9 credit hours from this group of courses towards the total credit requirement for your degree.
This means if you take multiple such courses, only the first 9 credit hours will count towards your degree requirements; any additional credits from these categories will not contribute to the minimum required credits for graduation.

3. Reasoning:
The limit encourages students to engage with core coursework and other structured classes that provide foundational knowledge and skills necessary for their field.
It ensures a balanced curriculum that combines theoretical learning with practical application.

Actionable Steps
If you're planning your course load:
Ensure that you do not exceed more than 9 credits from these specific types of courses if you want them all to count toward your degree completion.
Focus on fulfilling other core course requirements and electives needed for your major as outlined in your degree audit.

Conclusion

This policy helps maintain academic rigor while allowing some flexibility for personalized learning through independent studies or internships. If you have further questions about planning your coursework or need help selecting appropriate classes within these limits, consider discussing it with your academic advisor.
