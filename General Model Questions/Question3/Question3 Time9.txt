Assistant: Understanding Credit Hour Restrictions

In your Master of Science program at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, there is a specific restriction regarding certain courses that are categorized under directed independent study, research seminars, and internships. Here's how it works:

Courses Affected
Directed Independent Study: CSC 591, MIS 591
Research Seminar: CSC 595, MIS 595
Internship: CSC 598, MIS 598

Credit Limitations
You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours total from these courses towards the completion of your degree requirements.
This means you can choose any combination of these courses as long as their combined credit hours do not exceed 9.

Reasoning Behind the Restriction
1. Diverse Learning Experience: The restriction encourages students to engage in a diverse range of courses beyond just independent study or internships to gain broader knowledge and skills.
2. Balanced Curriculum: It ensures that students take a mix of theoretical and practical courses rather than focusing too heavily on self-directed or experiential learning opportunities alone.

Actionable Steps for Course Planning
1. Review Your Current Credits:
Check how many credits you have already taken or plan to take from these categories.
2. Plan Remaining Credits Wisely:
If you've reached or are close to reaching the 9-credit limit for these types of courses, focus on completing other core and elective course requirements.
3. Consult with Your Advisor:
Discuss your academic plan with your advisor to ensure you're meeting all necessary requirements without exceeding limitations.

Conclusion
Balancing coursework across various types helps create a well-rounded educational experience while ensuring you meet all degree requirements efficiently. Make sure to track your credits carefully and seek guidance from your academic advisor if needed.
