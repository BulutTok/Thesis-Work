Assistant: Certainly! Here's how the credit hour limitation works for your degree program:

Credit Hour Limitation Overview

1. Course Categories:
The courses CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 fall under categories like independent study, research seminar, or internship.
These courses typically offer flexible learning experiences such as individual research projects or practical work experience.

2. Maximum Credit Application:
You are allowed to apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from this set of courses toward the total credit requirement for your degree.
This means that even if you take more than these courses during your studies, only up to 9 credits will count towards fulfilling the required 36 credit hours needed for graduation.

3. Purpose of Limitation:
The limitation ensures that students have a balanced academic experience by engaging in both structured coursework and experiential learning.
It encourages exposure to comprehensive subject matter through standard courses while allowing some flexibility for personalized academic exploration.

4. Planning Your Coursework:
Ensure that your course plan includes a mix of core required courses and electives alongside these limited-credit options.
Be strategic about selecting which independent study or internship opportunities will best complement your academic goals within the allowable credits.

Actionable Steps
Review your current academic plan to confirm alignment with program requirements and limitations.
Balance elective choices with core course needs while considering how many independent study or internship credits you intend to apply toward your degree.
Regularly consult with your academic advisor to make informed decisions about course selections that align with both program guidelines and personal career aspirations.
