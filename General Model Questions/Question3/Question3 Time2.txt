Assistant: Certainly! The restriction on the number of credit hours from courses like CSC 591, MIS 591 (Directed Independent Study), CSC 595, MIS 595 (Research Seminar), CSC 598, and MIS 598 (Internship) that can be applied toward your degree is designed to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education with a balance between practical experience and theoretical knowledge.

Explanation

1. Course Types:
These courses are typically more focused on independent research, specialized topics not covered in regular coursework, or gaining practical work experience.
They offer flexibility for students to explore specific interests or gain hands-on experience in their field.

2. Credit Hour Limit:
You can count up to 9 credit hours from this group of courses towards the total credit requirement for your degree.
If you take more than 9 credits from these categories, only the first 9 will apply toward the degree requirements; additional credits will not count towards fulfilling the minimum required credits for graduation.

3. Rationale:
This limit encourages students to engage in a variety of courses that provide foundational knowledge and skills critical to their major.
It ensures that while students benefit from personalized learning experiences through independent studies or internships, they also complete core and elective coursework essential for comprehensive understanding in their discipline.

Actionable Steps
When planning your course schedule:
Ensure you select no more than 9 credits from these specific courses if you wish them all to count toward your degree completion.
Focus on fulfilling other core and elective course requirements as outlined in your degree audit.

Conclusion

This policy helps maintain academic rigor while allowing some flexibility for personalized learning through independent studies or internships. If you have further questions about planning your coursework or need help selecting appropriate classes within these limits, consider discussing it with your academic advisor.
