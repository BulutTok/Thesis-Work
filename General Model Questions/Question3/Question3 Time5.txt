Assistant: Certainly! Here's how the credit hour limitation works for your degree program:

Credit Hour Limitation Overview

1. Course Categories:
The courses CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 are categorized under independent study, research seminars, or internships.
These courses offer flexible learning experiences such as individual research projects or practical work experience.

2. Maximum Credit Application:
You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from this group of courses toward the total credit requirement for your Master of Science degree.
This means that while you may enroll in more than these courses during your studies, only up to 9 credits will count towards the required 36 credit hours needed for graduation.

3. Purpose of Limitation:
This limitation ensures that students receive a balanced academic experience by combining structured coursework with experiential learning opportunities.
It encourages exposure to core subject matter through standard classes while allowing some flexibility for personalized academic exploration.

4. Planning Your Coursework:
When planning your course schedule, ensure it includes a mix of core required courses and electives alongside these limited-credit options.
Be strategic about selecting which independent study or internship opportunities will best complement your academic and career goals within the allowable credits.

Actionable Steps
Review your current academic plan to ensure alignment with program requirements and limitations.
Balance elective choices with core course needs while considering how many independent study or internship credits you intend to apply toward your degree.
Regularly consult with your academic advisor to make informed decisions about course selections that align with both program guidelines and personal career aspirations.

Conclusion

The credit hour limitation is designed to provide a well-rounded educational experience by balancing traditional classroom learning with opportunities for individualized exploration. Plan accordingly to optimize your coursework within these parameters.
