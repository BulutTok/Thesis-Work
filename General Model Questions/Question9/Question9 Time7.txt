Assistant: Course Repetition Policy

1. Repeating a Course: If you do not achieve the required grade in a course, you may have the option to repeat it. However, this depends on the specific policies of your program and university guidelines.

2. Effect on Credit Count:
Generally, when you repeat a course, only the credits from one instance of the course will count towards your total credit requirement for graduation.
In most cases, if you pass the repeated course, those credits will replace the original attempt in your credit count.

3. Effect on GPA:
The grade from your repeated course can replace the previous grade in calculating your GPA, provided that this is allowed by your program's policies.
It's important to note that all attempts may still appear on your transcript even if only one affects your GPA calculation.

Steps to Take
Consult with Your Advisor: Before repeating any course, discuss it with your academic advisor to understand how it might affect your academic progress and financial aid status.
Check Program Policies: Review any specific policies regarding repeating courses within your program or department.
Plan Accordingly: Consider how repeating a course fits into your overall academic plan and timeline for graduation.

Conclusion

Repeating a course can be beneficial for improving both understanding and GPA but should be considered carefully within the context of your entire academic plan. Always consult with an advisor to make informed decisions based on official university policy.
