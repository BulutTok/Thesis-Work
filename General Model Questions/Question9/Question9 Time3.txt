Assistant: Course Repeat Policy and Impact on Credits and GPA

1. Repeating Courses:
Most courses in the curriculum, such as those in Computer Science (CSC) and Management Information Systems (MIS), are not repeatable for additional credit. This means if you do not achieve the required grade, you can retake the course to improve your grade, but it won't count as additional credits towards your degree requirements.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
When you repeat a course, only one set of credits from that course will apply toward your degree's total credit requirement. The repeated course does not add extra credits; it merely replaces the previous attempt's grade with the new one if it is higher.

3. Impact on GPA:
Retaking a course can positively affect your GPA if you achieve a higher grade on the second attempt. The new grade will replace the old grade in your GPA calculation, assuming it's better.
However, both attempts may appear on your transcript, showing that you have retaken the course.

4. Strategic Considerations:
Since a minimum GPA of 3.0 is required for graduation in your program, improving grades through repeating courses can be an effective strategy to boost your overall GPA.
It's important to prioritize courses where improving grades will have a significant impact on meeting graduation requirements or prerequisites for advanced courses.

Summary
Repeating a course provides an opportunity to improve your GPA without increasing total credit hours applied toward degree completion. It is advisable when you're aiming to meet specific academic performance standards or prerequisite requirements for subsequent courses within your program.
