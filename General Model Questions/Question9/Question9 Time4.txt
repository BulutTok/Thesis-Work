Assistant: Course Repeat Policy and Impact on Credits and GPA

1. Repeating Courses:
Most courses within your program, such as those in Computer Science (CSC) and Management Information Systems (MIS), are not designed to be repeated for additional credit. However, if you do not achieve the required grade, you may retake the course to improve your grade.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
When you repeat a course, only the credits from one attempt will count towards your degree's total credit requirement. The repeated course does not add extra credits but allows you to replace the previous grade with a new one if it is higher.

3. Impact on GPA:
Retaking a course can positively affect your GPA if you earn a higher grade on the second attempt. The new grade replaces the old one in your GPA calculation, assuming it is better.
Both attempts of the course may appear on your transcript, but only the most recent or highest grade will be used in calculating your cumulative GPA.

4. Strategic Considerations:
Since a minimum GPA of 3.0 is required for graduation in your program, improving grades through repeating courses can be an effective strategy to boost your overall GPA.
Prioritize retaking courses where improving grades will significantly impact meeting graduation requirements or prerequisites for more advanced courses.

Summary
Repeating a course provides an opportunity to enhance your GPA without increasing total credit hours applied toward degree completion. It is advisable when you're aiming to meet specific academic performance standards or prerequisite requirements for subsequent courses within your program.
