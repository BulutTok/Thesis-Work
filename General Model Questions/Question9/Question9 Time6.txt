Assistant: Course Repeatability and Its Impact

1. Course Repeatability:
Most courses in the provided course data may not be repeated for credit. This means that if you have taken a course and received a grade, you generally cannot retake it to earn additional credits toward your degree requirements.
If you need to improve your grade in a particular course to meet GPA requirements or prerequisites for another course, consult with your academic advisor about the possibility of repeating the course and any potential exceptions.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
Repeating a course does not contribute additional credits toward your degree since the repeat is intended for grade improvement rather than earning new credits.
The original attempt's credits will typically be replaced by those from the repeat attempt if allowed.

3. Impact on GPA:
Your GPA calculation will include only the most recent grade from a repeated course, assuming university policy permits replacing grades.
The previous grade will remain on your transcript but won't count towards your GPA once you've successfully completed the repeat (if permitted).

4. Consultation with Advisor:
Given that many courses are listed as non-repeatable, it's crucial to discuss options with your academic advisor who can provide guidance specific to university policies or potential waivers.

Action Steps
Review University Policies: Check specific university policies regarding repeating courses by consulting official resources like student handbooks or speaking with an academic advisor.
Advisor Consultation: Schedule a meeting with your academic advisor to discuss how repeating a course might fit into your overall academic plan and impact graduation timelines.
Transcript Review: Regularly review your transcript and degree audit reports to track progress toward meeting GPA and credit requirements.

Summary

Repeating courses is generally restricted unless specified otherwise in individual cases or through special permissions. While repeating can help improve grades for GPA calculations, it doesn't add new credits toward degree completion. Always verify options with an advisor who can tailor advice based on current policies and personal circumstances.
