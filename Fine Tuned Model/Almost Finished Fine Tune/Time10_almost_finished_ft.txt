Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  What impact do the credit hour restrictions for courses such as CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 have on my ability to pursue specialized topics within my field?

Assistant: Impact of Credit Hour Restrictions

The credit hour restrictions on courses like CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 limit the number of credits you can apply towards your degree from these specific courses. Here's how this impacts your ability to pursue specialized topics:

Considerations:

1. Limited Credits for Specialization:
You can only apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from these courses towards your degree. This means you need to carefully select which independent study or seminar topics will most benefit your specialization.

2. Prioritizing Topics:
Focus on choosing topics that align closely with your career goals and academic interests. Prioritize those that provide unique insights or skills not covered in other coursework.

3. Balancing Core Requirements:
Ensure that while pursuing specialized topics, you also meet all core requirements and do not exceed the allowed credits from these restricted categories.

4. Advisory Support:
Work closely with your advisor to strategically plan which courses will maximize both the breadth and depth of knowledge in your field.

5. Exploring Other Opportunities:
Consider other elective courses outside these restrictions that may offer additional specialized content relevant to your interests.

Summary
These restrictions require strategic planning to ensure you gain expertise in areas of interest without exceeding credit limits.
Collaborate with advisors and faculty to tailor a curriculum that effectively balances specialization with required competencies.

By navigating these restrictions wisely, you can still pursue meaningful specialization within the parameters set by your program.
