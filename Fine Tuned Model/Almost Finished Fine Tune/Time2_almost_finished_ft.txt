Assistant: Recommended Approach for Capstone Project

Registering for 3 credit hours per semester is the typical and advisable approach for your capstone project:

Register for another 3 credit hours to complete your project and prepare for the defense.
Focus on executing the project, analyzing results, and preparing your final presentation.

Alternative Approaches

If you prefer a more intensive schedule, consider registering for all 6 credits in one semester.
Ensure you have adequate time and resources to manage this workload effectively.
Consultation with Advisor:
Discuss these options with your academic advisor to tailor the plan according to your personal circumstances and program requirements.

Conclusion

The two-semester approach allows balanced workload distribution and thorough preparation. However, choose the method that best aligns with your capabilities and timeline.
