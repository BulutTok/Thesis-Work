Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  What are my options for earning the remaining 3 credits, and how might choosing an additional course versus a specific research project affect my workload and timeline?

Assistant: Evaluation of Current Academic Status
Credits Required: 36
Credits Completed: 33
Remaining Credits Needed: 3
GPA: 3.778

Options for Earning Remaining Credits

1. Course Enrollment:
You can choose a course from CSC 501:598 or MIS 500:598, excluding CSC 594 and MIS 594.
Consider the following courses that fit within your program:
CSC515 - Artificial Intelligence
CSC517 - Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
MIS503 - Programming For Analytics

2. Research Project or Thesis:
Complete the research project (CSC/MIS 594) by defending it successfully.
Alternatively, pursue a thesis with requirements like comprehensive oral exams and submission of final documents.

Impact on Workload and Timeline

Choosing an Additional Course:
Workload: Typically involves attending lectures, completing assignments, and taking exams.
Timeline: Likely to fit within a single semester, depending on course offerings and schedule.

Completing the Research Project or Thesis:
Workload: Involves intensive research work, regular meetings with advisors, and writing a substantial report or thesis.
Timeline: May extend over multiple semesters if not already in progress. Requires successful defense or submission of thesis-related documents.

Recommendations
If you prefer structured coursework with clear deadlines and want to complete your degree faster, enrolling in an additional course might be preferable.
If you enjoy research and have already made significant progress on your project/thesis, focusing on completing this requirement could provide more depth to your academic experience.

Conclusion

Consider your personal preferences for workload management and timeline goals. Since you are already working on a research project (CSC/MIS 594), it may be efficient to focus on its completion if you are close to defending it. Otherwise, selecting a suitable course can expedite graduation while diversifying your skills.
