Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  If there’s an unexpected delay in scheduling my CSC 594 Research Project defense, what alternative options or additional credit courses can I take to avoid postponing my graduation? 

Assistant: Evaluation of Current Status

You are currently enrolled in CSC 594 - Research Project for 6 credits, and you have completed or are in progress with most required courses. However, you need an additional 3 credits to meet the degree requirements.

Recommendations for Additional Courses

1. Course Selection: Since you need to complete 3 more credits and can't use CSC 594 again, consider enrolling in any available course within the range CSC 501-598 or MIS 500-598, excluding CSC/MIS 594.
   
   Here are some options:
CSC502 - Machine Learning Fundamentals: If not already completed.
MIS503 - Programming For Analytics: This could be a useful skill if you're interested in data analytics.
MIS504 - Databases for Analytics: Offers foundational skills that are widely applicable.

2. Consideration of Prerequisites: Ensure you meet any prerequisites for these courses. For example, MIS506 requires MIS503 as a prerequisite.

Continuous Enrollment Option

If there is no suitable course available immediately:
Register for CSC600 - Continuous Enrollment, which allows you to maintain your status while resolving project defense delays.

Actionable Steps
Check Course Availability: Verify which courses are open for enrollment this semester.
Consult with Advisor: Discuss these options with your advisor, Devon Simmonds, to ensure alignment with graduation goals.
Enroll Early: Secure your spot in an alternative course or continuous enrollment promptly to avoid delays.

Summary

By enrolling in an additional course such as MIS503 or considering continuous enrollment (CSC600), you can maintain progress towards your degree without postponing graduation due to scheduling conflicts with your research project defense.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  With my GPA at 3.778 and almost all degree requirements complete, are there any departmental honors or recognition programs I should consider applying for before graduating?

Assistant: Evaluation of Current Status

Your GPA is 3.778, which is well above the minimum requirement for most honors programs. You are also nearing completion of your degree requirements.

Honors and Recognition Opportunities

1. Departmental Honors: 
Check if your department offers honors designations for students with high academic performance. This might require a separate application or nomination by faculty.

2. Graduate School Awards:
Look into any awards or recognitions offered by the Graduate School for outstanding academic achievements or contributions to research.

3. Thesis/Project Awards:
If applicable, consider submitting your thesis or research project for any competitions or awards that recognize exceptional scholarly work.

4. Professional Associations:
Explore memberships in professional associations related to Computer Science and Information Systems that offer student recognition programs.

5. Dean’s List/Graduate Honors:
Verify if there are university-wide recognitions such as Dean's Lists or Graduate Honors that you might qualify for based on your GPA and achievements.

Actionable Steps
Contact Department: Inquire about specific departmental honors with your advisor, Devon Simmonds.
Review Graduate School Website: Look for information on available awards and recognitions.
Network with Faculty: Discuss potential nominations with faculty members who are familiar with your work.

Summary

With your strong academic standing, you should explore departmental honors, graduate school awards, and other recognition opportunities before graduation to enhance your academic profile and career prospects.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  My audit shows I still need 3 credits—would it be more beneficial to take an elective that complements my research project or to focus solely on administrative tasks related to graduation, such as completing necessary forms?

Assistant: Evaluation of Current Status

You need 3 additional credits to meet your degree requirements. You are also working on your research project, which involves several administrative tasks for graduation.

Recommendations

1. Elective Course: 
Complementary Elective: Choose an elective that aligns with or enhances your research project. This could provide additional insights or skills relevant to your work.
Consider courses like:
CSC502 - Machine Learning Fundamentals: If it relates to your research.
MIS505 - Data Visualization: To enhance presentation and analysis skills.

2. Administrative Tasks:
Ensure all forms related to graduation, such as the thesis submission and defense paperwork, are completed timely.
These tasks are crucial but should not require a full semester's focus.

Actionable Steps
Balance Both: Enroll in a complementary elective while managing graduation tasks concurrently.
Consult Advisor: Discuss potential electives with Devon Simmonds to ensure they align with your goals.
Plan Administrative Timeline: Create a schedule for completing necessary forms and tasks alongside coursework.

Summary

Taking an elective that complements your research while simultaneously handling administrative tasks is the most beneficial approach. This strategy allows you to fulfill credit requirements and enhance the quality of your research project without delaying graduation.
