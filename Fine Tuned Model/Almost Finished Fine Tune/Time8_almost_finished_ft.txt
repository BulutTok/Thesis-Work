Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  How does transferring credits from another institution or previous studies affect my overall progress toward the degree?

Assistant: Evaluating Transfer Credits

Transferring credits can significantly impact your progress toward your degree by potentially reducing the number of courses you need to complete. Here's how it generally works:

1. Credit Evaluation:
The university will evaluate your transferred credits to determine their equivalency to courses offered in your program.
Only credits that match the curriculum and meet the academic standards will be accepted.

2. Impact on Degree Progress:
Accepted transfer credits count toward the total credit requirement for graduation.
They can fulfill specific course requirements if they align with required or elective courses in your degree plan.

3. GPA Consideration:
Transfer credits typically do not affect your GPA at UNCW as grades from previous institutions are not included in the GPA calculation here.

4. Limitations and Restrictions:
There may be a cap on the number of transferable credits.
Some programs require that a certain number of upper-level courses be completed at UNCW.

Actionable Steps
Submit Transcripts: Ensure all official transcripts from previous institutions are submitted to UNCW for evaluation.
Consult Your Advisor: Work with your academic advisor to understand how these credits apply specifically to your degree requirements.
Review Degree Audit: Regularly check your degree audit report for updates on transferred credits and remaining requirements.

Conclusion

Transferring credits can accelerate your path to graduation by fulfilling course and credit requirements, but it's essential to ensure they align with your current program's needs. Always coordinate closely with your academic advisor for optimal planning.
