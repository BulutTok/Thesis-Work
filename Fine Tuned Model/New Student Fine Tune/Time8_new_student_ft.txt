Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  What does it mean when my degree audit indicates "0% degree progress" and "0 credits applied," and what steps should I take to begin accumulating credits?

Assistant: Understanding "0% Degree Progress" and "0 Credits Applied"

Meaning:
0% Degree Progress: You haven't started your coursework toward your degree yet.
0 Credits Applied: You haven't earned any credits that count toward your degree requirements.

Steps to Begin Accumulating Credits

1. Review Core Course Requirements:
Start with required core courses as they form the foundation of your program.
Required core courses include:
CSC 532 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms I
MIS 534 - Information Security Management
CSC 544 - Network Programming
CSC 550 - Software Engineering
MIS 555 - Database Management Systems
MIS 565 - Analysis, Modeling, and Design

2. Enroll in Core Courses:
Check course availability for the upcoming semester.
Register for these courses through your student portal.

3. Plan Additional Courses:
You need additional credits from courses numbered CSC 501-598 or MIS 500-598 (excluding CSC/MIS 594).

4. Research or Thesis Requirement:
   Choose one path:
Research Project: Enroll in CSC/MIS 594 (6 credits).
Thesis: Enroll in CSC/MIS 599 (6 credits).

5. Meet with an Academic Advisor:
   Schedule a meeting to discuss your academic plan, ensure you're on track, and clarify any questions about prerequisites or course sequences.

Summary

To begin making progress, enroll in core courses immediately available and plan for additional coursework. Regularly consult with your advisor to ensure you’re meeting all program requirements efficiently.

Choosing Your Pathway
Consider your career goals and whether you prefer a practical application (project) or an in-depth research study (thesis).
Discuss with your advisor to determine which option aligns best with your interests and future plans. 

Both pathways require planning and adherence to deadlines, so ensure you are well-prepared regardless of which option you choose.
