Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  Since MIS503 covers programming in both R and Python, do you recommend any preparatory resources or prior exposure to either language before starting the course?

Assistant: Preparatory Resources for MIS503

R and Python Basics:
Online Courses: Consider platforms like Coursera or edX that offer introductory courses in R and Python.
*Coursera:* "Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)" by the University of Michigan.
*edX:* "Introduction to R for Data Science" by Microsoft.

Books:
Python: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart is great for beginners.
R: "R for Data Science" by Hadley Wickham is a comprehensive introduction.

Practice Platforms:
Codecademy: Offers interactive lessons on both R and Python.
Kaggle: Provides notebooks to practice coding and explore datasets in R and Python.

Additional Tips:
Familiarize yourself with basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
Explore data manipulation libraries like pandas (Python) or dplyr (R).

These resources will help you build a solid foundation before starting MIS503.
