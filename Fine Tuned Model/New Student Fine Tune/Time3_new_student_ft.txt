As a new student, you should focus on enrolling in the core courses required for your program. Based on the provided degree audit, here are the core courses you need to complete:

1. CSC 532 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms I
2. MIS 534 - Information Security Management
3. CSC 544 - Network Programming
4. CSC 550 - Software Engineering
5. MIS 555 - Database Management Systems
6. MIS 565 - Analysis, Modeling and Design

Course Offerings

From the course data available, some courses have specific scheduled offerings:
CSC 532: Offered in Spring 2025
MIS 534: Offered in Spring 2025
For other courses like CSC 544, CSC 550, MIS 555, and MIS 565, there is no specific semester information available in the current dataset.

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  I understand that to be considered full-time, I need to register for at least 9 but no more than 15 credit hours. How can I ensure my planned schedule meets this requirement?

Assistant: Full-Time Enrollment Requirements

To be considered a full-time student, you need to register for at least 9 credit hours. Here's how you can ensure your schedule meets this requirement:

Current Course Options

1. CSC 532 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms I (3 credits)

These two courses together will give you 6 credit hours.

Additional Courses to Consider

To reach the full-time status of at least 9 credit hours, consider adding another course:
CSC 502 - Machine Learning Fundamentals (3 credits): Offered in Spring 2025
BAN500 - Descriptive Analytics (3 credits): Available online asynchronously in Spring 2025

Actionable Steps

1. Register for CSC 532 and MIS 534: These are core requirements and should be prioritized.
   
2. Choose an Additional Course:
Select from CSC 502 or BAN500 to meet the minimum requirement of 9 credit hours.

3. Consult with Advisor: Confirm that these courses align with your academic plan and check if any additional options become available.

3. Submit the Form:
Follow instructions on how to submit the form, either online or in person, as specified by the Graduate School.

4. Register for Continuous Enrollment:
Once approved, enroll in MIS600 or CSC600 (Continuous Enrollment) through your student portal.

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  Can you explain the recommended distribution of capstone credit hours—specifically, how many should be registered for during the proposal phase and how many during the final completion and defense phase?

Assistant: Capstone Credit Hour Distribution

The typical approach for distributing capstone credit hours is as follows:

1. Proposal Phase:
Register for 3 credit hours during the semester you work on your capstone proposal.

2. Completion and Defense Phase:
Register for an additional 3 credit hours in the following semester to complete and defend your capstone project.

Actionable Steps
First Semester (Proposal): Enroll in 3 capstone credit hours to focus on developing your proposal.
Second Semester (Completion/Defense): Enroll in another 3 credit hours to finalize and defend your project.

Conclusion

This distribution ensures a balanced workload across two semesters, allowing you adequate time for both preparation and completion of your capstone project.
