Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  I need to choose between a research project (CSC594/MIS594) and a thesis (CSC599/MIS599) for my research credits. What are the main differences in requirements and expectations for each option?

Assistant: Here's a breakdown of the key differences between the research project and thesis options:

Research Project (CSC594/MIS594)
Credits Required: 6 credits
Focus: Practical application of computer science or information systems under faculty guidance.
Requirements:
Select a topic with faculty approval.
Complete a written analysis and oral presentation.
Successfully defend the research project.

Thesis (CSC599/MIS599)
Credits Required: 6 credits
Focus: Intensive research study on a selected topic, approved by a thesis committee.
Requirements:
Pass a comprehensive oral exam.
Submit and defend the thesis.
Submit draft and final versions electronically to the Graduate School, including necessary documentation such as Format Approval Sheet, Signed Thesis Title Page, and ETD Submission Form.

Considerations:
Research Project is generally more applied and may be suitable if you prefer practical work or are considering entering the industry directly after graduation.
Thesis is more research-intensive, making it ideal if you're considering further academic pursuits or a career in research.

Recommendations:
1. Evaluate Interests: Consider your career goals and interests in practical vs. theoretical work.
2. Consult Faculty: Discuss with potential advisors to understand their expectations for each option.

Credit Limit: Maximum of 9 credit hours can be applied from these courses toward your degree.

Planning Steps

1. Prioritize Core and Required Courses:
Ensure you complete all core requirements like CSC 544 (Network Programming) and MIS 555 (Database Management Systems).

2. Select Electives Wisely:
Choose electives that fulfill degree requirements without exceeding the credit limit on the specified courses.
Consider other available electives in CSC/MIS that align with your interests and career goals.

3. Balance Research or Thesis Credits:
Decide between a research project or thesis early to allocate credits accordingly.
Remember that these options are separate from the affected courses.

4. Advising Session:
Schedule a meeting with your academic advisor to review your plan and ensure you're meeting all requirements efficiently.

5. Monitor Credit Hours:
Keep track of how many credits you've taken within the restricted courses to avoid exceeding limits.

By carefully selecting your courses while keeping this limitation in mind, you'll stay on track for graduation without any issues related to excess credits from restricted categories. If you need more assistance with specific course options, let me know!
