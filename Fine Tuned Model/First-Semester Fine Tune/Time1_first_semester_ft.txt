Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  I noticed the report mentions that no more than 9 credit hours from courses like CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 can be applied toward my degree. Could you clarify how this policy works and what it means for my course planning?

Assistant: Certainly! Here's how the policy works and what it means for your course planning:

Policy Explanation
Limit on Credits: You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from the specified courses (CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598) toward your degree.
Course Types: These courses typically involve independent study, seminars, or internships.

Implications for Course Planning

1. Select Wisely:
Choose these courses based on how they align with your career goals and interests since only a limited number can count toward your degree.

Ensure that you also complete all required core courses and electives outside of this list to meet the total credit requirement for graduation.

3. Consult Your Advisor:
Discuss which of these options might best support your academic and professional development.

4. Plan Electives Carefully:
Consider other electives within CSC or MIS that interest you and contribute to reaching the total credits needed without exceeding the limit from these specific courses.

By understanding this policy, you can strategically plan your coursework to fulfill all requirements efficiently while maximizing learning opportunities relevant to your goals. If you have more questions about specific courses or need further guidance, feel free to ask!
