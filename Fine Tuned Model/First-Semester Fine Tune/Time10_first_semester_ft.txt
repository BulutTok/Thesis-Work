Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  Could you explain how the “In-progress Credits” and “Classes applied” numbers are calculated on my audit, and when updates are typically reflected?

Assistant: Understanding In-progress Credits and Classes Applied

In-progress Credits:
These are the credits for courses you are currently enrolled in but have not yet completed. They contribute to your total credit requirement once successfully completed.

Classes Applied:
This refers to the number of classes that are currently counting towards your degree requirements, including those you are currently taking.

Calculation Example
You have 12 in-progress credits from four courses (CSC 532, CSC 550, MIS 503, MIS 534), each worth 3 credits.

Updates Reflection
Your audit updates typically at the end of each semester when grades are posted. If you drop or add courses during the semester, it may also reflect changes sooner.

Conclusion
Keep track of your academic progress through these metrics and consult with your advisor if there are any discrepancies or concerns.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  If I need to retake a core course to boost my GPA, how does the policy limiting repeated courses (maximum 9 credit hours) affect my options?

Assistant: Understanding the Repeat Policy

Policy Details:
You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from repeated courses like CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 towards your degree.

Retaking Core Courses:
Retaking a core course to improve your GPA does not fall under this repeat policy limit. The limitation applies specifically to independent studies, seminars, and internships.

Strategy for Boosting GPA
1. Identify Core Courses: Focus on retaking core courses where you received lower grades.
2. Plan Accordingly: Ensure that you have room within your overall credit plan to accommodate any repeats without exceeding limits on other repeated courses.
3. Consult Your Advisor: Discuss which courses would be most beneficial to retake based on their impact on your GPA and degree progress.

Conclusion
The repeat policy primarily affects elective or supplementary courses rather than core requirements. Prioritize improving grades in core subjects if needed for GPA improvement.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  How are elective courses or additional credits beyond the core requirements factored into my degree audit, and is there a limit on non-major credits?

Assistant: Elective Courses and Additional Credits

Elective Courses:
Electives are courses you choose beyond your core requirements. They can help fulfill the total credit requirement for your degree.

Degree Audit:
Your audit tracks both core and elective credits. It ensures that all credits contribute towards the 36-credit requirement for your Master of Science degree.

Non-Major Credits:
While electives offer flexibility, they should align with your program’s guidelines. Check with your advisor if there’s a specific limit on non-major credits to ensure they count towards your degree.

Strategy
1. Align Electives: Choose electives that complement your major or career goals.
2. Verify Limits: Confirm any restrictions on non-major or unrelated elective credits with your advisor.
3. Track Progress: Regularly review your degree audit to ensure all chosen courses count towards completion.

Conclusion
While electives provide room for exploration, ensure they fit within any program-specific guidelines to effectively count towards graduation requirements.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  What are the prerequisites for CSC 537 – Parallel Computing?

Assistant: Prerequisites for CSC 537 – Parallel Computing
Prerequisite Course: CSC 340 with a minimum grade of C.

Ensure you meet this prerequisite before enrolling in CSC 537 to align with the program requirements.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  Are there flexible learning options, such as online courses or independent study, to help me complete my credit requirements?

Assistant: Flexible Learning Options

Online Courses:
Many courses, like MIS 503 and BAN 500, offer fully online asynchronous options, allowing you to complete coursework at your own pace.

Independent Study:
Courses: CSC 591 or MIS 591.
Credits: Typically between 1 to 6 credits.
Requirements: Permission of the instructor is needed.

Strategy
1. Explore Online Offerings: Check for courses in your program that are available online to fit your schedule.
2. Consider Independent Study: If you have a specific area of interest, discuss potential independent study options with faculty.
3. Plan Your Schedule: Mix online and in-person classes if needed to balance your workload.

Conclusion
Utilize online courses and independent studies as flexible learning paths to efficiently meet your credit requirements while accommodating personal and professional commitments.
