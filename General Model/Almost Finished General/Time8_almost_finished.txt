Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  How does transferring credits from another institution or previous studies affect my overall progress toward the degree?

Assistant: Transferring credits from another institution or previous studies can significantly affect your overall progress toward a degree in several ways:

Evaluation of Transfer Credits

1. Credit Evaluation: The first step is to have your previous coursework evaluated by the university's admissions or registrar office. They will determine which credits are transferable and applicable to your current degree program.

2. Course Equivalency: Courses you have taken previously may be equivalent to courses required for your current degree. This means that if a course you've completed matches the curriculum and learning outcomes of a required course at UNCW, it might fulfill that requirement.

3. Credit Limits: There may be a limit on the number of credits that can be transferred toward your degree. It’s important to know these limits as they vary by program and institution.

Impact on Degree Progress

1. Reduction in Required Credits: Accepted transfer credits reduce the total number of credit hours you need to complete at UNCW, potentially accelerating your time to graduation.

2. Fulfillment of Prerequisites: Transfer credits can fulfill prerequisite requirements, allowing you to enroll in advanced courses sooner than if you were starting from scratch.

3. GPA Consideration: Typically, while transfer credits count toward fulfilling credit requirements, they do not impact your GPA at UNCW since grades from other institutions are not included in GPA calculations here.

4. Residency Requirements: Most programs require students to complete a certain number of credits directly through their institution (UNCW in this case). Ensure that your transfer does not interfere with meeting these residency requirements.

Actionable Steps
Contact Your Advisor: Discuss with your academic advisor how transfer credits might apply specifically to your program and what documentation is needed.
Submit Transcripts Early: Provide official transcripts from previous institutions early in the process for evaluation.
Review Degree Audit Report: Regularly check your degree audit report (like Degree Works) after transferring credits to understand how they fit into your overall plan.
Understand Policies: Familiarize yourself with UNCW’s policies regarding transfer credit limits, grade requirements, and any specific conditions related to transfers.

Conclusion

Transfer credits can positively influence your academic trajectory by reducing coursework load and allowing earlier access to advanced classes, thus potentially shortening the time required for completing a degree. However, it's crucial to navigate this process carefully with guidance from advisors and administrative offices to ensure all procedures are correctly followed and benefits maximized.

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  How are in-progress courses counted in my degree audit, and what should I do if a course is marked as incomplete or in-progress for an extended period?

Assistant: In-progress courses are an essential component of your degree audit, and understanding how they are counted can help you manage your academic progress effectively. Here's how in-progress courses are typically handled and what steps you should take if a course is marked as incomplete or in-progress for an extended period:

How In-Progress Courses Are Counted

1. Temporary Status: Courses that you are currently enrolled in but have not yet completed are marked as "in-progress" on your degree audit. They contribute to your total credit count temporarily until a final grade is posted.

2. Credit Allocation: While the credits for these courses may be included in the calculation of your current load (for full-time status, financial aid, etc.), they do not affect your GPA until the course is completed and a grade is assigned.

3. Progress Monitoring: The degree audit system will display these courses as part of your ongoing requirements, indicating that completion is necessary to fulfill specific degree conditions.

Steps to Take If a Course Is Marked as Incomplete or In-Progress for an Extended Period

1. Contact Your Instructor: If a course remains marked as incomplete beyond its expected completion date, reach out to the instructor to understand why it hasn't been finalized. It could be due to pending grades or unresolved coursework.

2. Check Administrative Holds: Ensure there are no administrative holds on your account that might prevent grades from being posted, such as unpaid fees or missing documentation.

3. Review University Policies: Familiarize yourself with university policies regarding incomplete grades:
Some institutions allow students extra time under specific circumstances (e.g., medical issues).
There may be deadlines by which incompletes must be resolved before they convert into failing grades.
   
4. Submit Required Work Promptly: If you've been granted an extension due to extenuating circumstances, prioritize completing any outstanding work promptly within the allowed timeframe.
