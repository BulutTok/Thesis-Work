Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  In my final semester, if I’m not taking a full course load, how can I adjust my schedule to meet the full-time enrollment requirement of 9–15 credit hours?

Assistant: Evaluating Your Current Situation
Current Enrollment: You are completing your final semester with several in-progress courses.
Full-Time Requirement: As a graduate student, you need to maintain 9–15 credit hours for full-time status.

Options to Meet Full-Time Enrollment

1. Enroll in Additional Courses:
Consider enrolling in one or more additional courses to meet the 9-credit hour minimum if you're currently below this threshold.
Review your academic interests and career goals to select appropriate courses. For instance, consider electives that complement your ongoing research or enhance skills relevant to your field.

2. Continuous Enrollment:
If you have completed all coursework but still need to finish a capstone project or thesis, consider registering for continuous enrollment. This option allows you to maintain full-time status without taking additional traditional courses.
For details on continuous enrollment, visit the [Graduate School Forms](https://uncw.edu/myuncw/academics/graduate-school/forms) page and complete the necessary forms.

3. Research or Directed Study:
Register for directed independent study (CSC591/MIS591) or research seminar (CSC595/MIS595) if applicable, as these can provide flexibility while allowing you to focus on specific areas of interest under faculty supervision.
These options can also help fulfill any remaining credit requirements while providing valuable research experience.

Actionable Steps
Review Course Offerings: Check available courses for the upcoming term that fit within your schedule and interests.
Consult Your Advisor: Discuss your current situation with your academic advisor, Devon Simmonds, to ensure all options align with degree requirements and personal circumstances.
Complete Necessary Forms: If opting for continuous enrollment or directed study, ensure all forms are completed promptly to secure enrollment.

By taking these steps, you can adjust your schedule accordingly while meeting the university's full-time enrollment requirements and ensuring a smooth path toward graduation.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  As an international student nearing graduation, how can I confirm that my final semester schedule meets the visa requirement of 6 hours of in-person courses?

Assistant: Evaluating Your Current Academic and Visa Requirements
Visa Requirement for International Students: To maintain your F-1 visa status, you must enroll in at least 9 credit hours, with a minimum of 6 credit hours being in-person courses.

Steps to Ensure Compliance with Visa Requirements

1. Review Current Course Enrollment:
Confirm the mode of instruction for your current courses. You need at least two courses (totaling 6 credit hours) that are delivered in-person or have a significant in-person component.
   
2. Course Schedule Verification:
Check each course's schedule details to ensure they meet the in-person requirement:
Look for designations such as "F2F" (Face-to-Face) or specific classroom locations and times indicating physical attendance is necessary.
For example, courses like CSC532 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms I), which are labeled as requiring attendance and participation in person at specified days/times, will fulfill this requirement.

3. Adjust Schedule if Necessary:
If any of your enrolled courses do not meet the in-person criteria, consider adjusting your schedule by enrolling in other available face-to-face courses.
Review potential electives or required courses that fit within your academic plan while meeting the visa requirements.

4. Consult with an International Student Advisor:
Reach out to the international student office at UNCW for additional guidance on maintaining compliance with visa regulations.
They can provide further clarification and assistance if there are any concerns about your course selections relative to visa requirements.

5. Official Resources:
Refer to the [UNCW Full-Time Status](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status) page for comprehensive guidelines on full-time enrollment standards.

Summary

By verifying your current course schedule against these steps, you can ensure compliance with both university policies and visa requirements, allowing you to focus on successfully completing your degree program while maintaining legal student status in the U.S.

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  For my capstone project, is it advisable to register for 3 credit hours per semester (one for the proposal and one for the final defense), or are there alternative recommended approaches for someone in the final stages of their program?

Assistant: Evaluating Capstone Project Registration
Current Academic Stage: You are in the final stages of your program, focusing on completing your capstone project.
Credit Hour Requirement: Typically, students register for 3 credit hours per semester for their capstone work.

Recommended Approach for Capstone Project

1. Standard Practice:
First Semester (Proposal): Register for 3 credit hours to work on developing and submitting your capstone proposal. This allows you to focus on planning, researching, and drafting the initial stages of your project.
Second Semester (Completion/Defense): Register for another 3 credit hours to complete the project and prepare for the defense. This phase involves finalizing your research, writing up results, and preparing for any presentations or oral defenses required.

2. Benefits of Standard Approach:
Provides a structured timeline that aligns with typical academic schedules.
Ensures adequate time is allocated to both proposal development and project completion without overwhelming workloads in a single semester.
Allows you to maintain full-time status if combined with other coursework or continuous enrollment options as needed.

3. Alternative Approaches:
If you have already made significant progress on your capstone project or have lighter course loads due to completed requirements, consider discussing with your advisor about accelerating the process within one semester.
Some students opt to take more than 3 credits in a single semester if they feel confident in managing their workload effectively.

4. Consultation with Advisor:
Discuss these options with your academic advisor, Devon Simmonds, who can provide personalized guidance based on your progress and specific circumstances.
Your advisor can also help ensure that any deviations from the standard practice still meet all graduation requirements.

Summary

The typical recommendation is to register for 3 credit hours per semester over two semesters (one focused on the proposal and one on completion/defense). However, depending on individual progress and workload capacity, alternative strategies may be viable with advisor consultation. This approach balances maintaining full-time status while providing dedicated timeframes for each stage of the capstone project.
