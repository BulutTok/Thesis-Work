Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  Since I’m enrolled in CSC 594 Research Project (6 credits), what are the next steps for successfully defending my project and completing the final project requirement as outlined in my audit?

Assistant: Steps for Successfully Defending Your Research Project

To fulfill the research project requirement and successfully defend your project, you need to complete several key steps. Here’s a structured approach to guide you through this process:

Step 1: Complete the Research Project
Finalize Your Research: Ensure that all components of your research are completed. This includes data collection, analysis, and drawing conclusions.
Draft Your Report: Write a comprehensive report detailing your research methodology, findings, and implications.

Step 2: Prepare for Defense
Schedule the Defense: Contact your faculty advisor or graduate coordinator to schedule a date for your defense. Ensure that it aligns with departmental deadlines.
Prepare Presentation: Develop a clear and concise presentation summarizing your research. Practice delivering it to ensure clarity and confidence during the actual defense.
Seek Feedback: Before the defense, seek feedback from peers or mentors on both your report and presentation.

Step 3: Execute Defense Requirements
Oral Defense (DEFN): Present your research findings to a committee as scheduled. Be prepared to answer questions about your work and its broader impact.
Final Project Submission (PROJ): After incorporating any feedback from the defense, submit the final version of your project report as required by your department.

Step 4: Administrative Follow-Up
Submit Required Documents: If there are any forms or additional documents needed post-defense (e.g., signed approval forms), make sure these are submitted promptly.
Verify Completion Status: Check with the graduate school or relevant department office to confirm that all requirements have been officially recorded as complete.

Summary of Actions
1. Finalize and draft your research project report.
2. Schedule and prepare for the oral defense by coordinating with faculty advisors.
3. Conduct a successful oral defense and submit final documents as required.
4. Confirm completion status with administrative offices.

By adhering to these steps diligently, you'll be well-prepared to meet the necessary requirements for defending your research project effectively. For detailed instructions or specific forms related to submissions, visit the [Graduate School Forms](https://uncw.edu/myuncw/academics/graduate-school/forms) page.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  The degree audit lists both research project and thesis requirements—having completed the research project, am I exempt from the thesis-related items (like the comprehensive oral exam, draft thesis submission, and thesis defense), or do any of these still apply to me?

Assistant: Clarification on Degree Requirements

Based on your degree audit and the information provided, it appears that you are enrolled in a Research Project (CSC 594) for 6 credits. This typically means that you have opted for the research project track instead of the thesis track. Here’s how this affects your requirements:

Research Project Track vs. Thesis Track
Research Project Track:
You are required to complete and defend a research project.
You need to meet the defense requirement for your project as outlined earlier.
Thesis Track:
Involves comprehensive tasks such as a draft thesis submission, thesis defense, and other related documentation.
These requirements generally do not apply if you are solely completing a research project.

Your Current Standing

Given that you are completing CSC 594 (Research Project), the thesis-related items such as:
Comprehensive Oral Exam
Draft Thesis Submission
Thesis Defense Requirement
Format Approval Sheet
Final Thesis Submission
Signed Thesis Title Page
ETD Submission Form

do not apply to your current academic track focused on the research project.

Actionable Steps

1. Focus on Completing Your Research Project: Ensure all components of your project defense and final report submission are completed.
2. Verify with Advisor: For absolute clarity, consult with your primary advisor or graduate coordinator to confirm that no additional thesis-related requirements pertain to your degree path.
3. Administrative Confirmation: After defending your research project, check with administrative offices to ensure all necessary records reflect completion accurately.

By confirming these details with university officials, you'll ensure compliance with graduation requirements specific to your chosen academic path without unnecessary obligations from the thesis track.
