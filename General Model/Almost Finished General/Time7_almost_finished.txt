Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  If I want to switch from the research project option to a thesis route later on, what steps would I need to take, and how would that affect my current course credits?

Assistant: Steps to Switch from Research Project to Thesis Route

1. Consult Your Advisor:
Begin by discussing your intention with your academic advisor, Devon Simmonds. They can provide personalized guidance and ensure that this switch aligns with your academic and career goals.

2. Review Program Requirements:
Verify the specific requirements for the thesis route in your program's curriculum. Ensure you understand the expectations, including thesis submission, defense, and any additional coursework.

3. Submit a Change Request:
You may need to formally request a change in your degree path through the Graduate School or your department. This could involve completing a form or submitting a written request.

4. Adjust Course Registration:
If switching to a thesis route affects your course schedule, you may need to drop or add courses accordingly. Discuss this with your advisor to ensure it doesn't impact your graduation timeline.

5. Meet Thesis Requirements:
Familiarize yourself with all thesis requirements listed in the audit report:
Comprehensive Oral Exam
Thesis Defense Requirement
Draft Thesis Submission
Format Approval Sheet Submission
Final Thesis Submission
Signed Thesis Title Page Submission
Electronic Thesis Form Submission

Impact on Current Course Credits
Credits Applied: 
  Since you're currently enrolled in CSC 594 (Research Project) for 6 credits, these may not directly apply if you switch to a thesis option unless they are counted towards elective credits or other degree requirements.
Thesis Credits: 
  You will likely need to enroll in CSC 599 (Thesis), which typically requires between 1-6 credits depending on departmental guidelines and how many times you choose to register for it over different semesters.
Overall Credit Requirement: 
  Ensure that any changes still meet the overall credit requirement of 36 credits needed for graduation.

Summary

Switching from a research project to a thesis will involve consulting with advisors, submitting formal requests, adjusting course registrations, and fulfilling additional thesis-specific requirements. It's crucial to ensure that these changes align with both programmatic guidelines and personal academic goals while maintaining progress toward meeting total credit requirements for graduation.
