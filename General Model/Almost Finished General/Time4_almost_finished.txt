A revised timeline with proposed new deadlines.
Any supporting documentation (e.g., medical notes, letters from employers).

4. Advisor Approval:
Obtain approval from your advisor for the extension request before proceeding further.

5. Departmental Submission:
Submit your formal extension request to the department chair or graduate program coordinator, following any specific departmental procedures.

6. Graduate School Notification:
If necessary, notify the Graduate School about changes in your timeline, especially if they affect thesis submission deadlines or graduation applications.

Potential Impact on Graduation Timeline
Graduation Delay: 
An approved extension may push back key deliverables such as your defense date or final thesis submission, potentially delaying your graduation by one semester.
Enrollment Requirements:
Ensure you remain enrolled in continuous enrollment courses (like CSC600) if extending beyond current semester deadlines without completing all degree requirements.
Financial Considerations:
Be aware of any financial implications related to extending enrollment, including tuition fees and financial aid eligibility adjustments.

Actionable Steps

1. Act quickly upon recognizing any potential delays; early intervention is key to minimizing impacts.
2. Collaborate closely with your advisor throughout this process—they can provide valuable support and advocacy when requesting extensions.
3. Regularly review academic policies related to extensions on both departmental and university levels via relevant websites or handbooks.
4. Plan ahead for potential financial implications of extended study periods—consult with Financial Aid Office if needed.

Summary

Requesting an extension requires timely action and clear communication with both advisors and departmental administrators. While extensions can affect your graduation timeline by delaying completion dates, proper planning can help manage these impacts effectively while ensuring you meet all academic requirements successfully despite unforeseen challenges.
