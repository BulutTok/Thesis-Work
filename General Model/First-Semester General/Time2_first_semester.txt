Impact on Credit Accumulation and GPA
Credit Hours:
You will earn credit hours only once for a repeated course towards your degree requirements, even if you take it multiple times.
GPA Calculation:
The most recent grade received in a repeated course is used to calculate your cumulative GPA, replacing the previous grade.
This can positively impact your GPA if you achieve a higher grade upon retaking the course.
Transcript Record:
All attempts will appear on your transcript, but only the latest attempt affects your GPA calculation.
Financial Aid Considerations:
Check with Financial Aid Office regarding how retaking courses might affect your financial aid status or eligibility, as some aid packages have restrictions related to repeat coursework.
