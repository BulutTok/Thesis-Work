Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  I need to choose between a research project (CSC594/MIS594) and a thesis (CSC599/MIS599) for my research credits. What are the key differences in the requirements and processes for each option?

Assistant: Choosing between a research project and a thesis is an important decision that can impact your academic and professional trajectory. Here are the key differences between the two options, along with their respective requirements and processes:

Research Project (CSC 594/MIS 594)

Overview:
A research project involves focused study on a specific topic within computer science or information systems, often with practical applications.
The outcome is typically a written report and an oral presentation.

Requirements:
Credits: Typically requires 6 credits.
Approval: Topics are selected by the student with faculty and graduate coordinator approval.
Defense: You must successfully defend your research project in front of a committee.

Process:
1. Topic Selection: Choose a topic that aligns with your interests and career goals.
2. Faculty Supervision: Work under the guidance of a faculty member who will provide mentorship throughout the project.
3. Research & Development: Conduct research, develop solutions or models as needed, and compile findings into a final report.
4. Presentation & Defense: Present your findings to an audience which may include faculty members, peers, or industry professionals.

Thesis (CSC 599/MIS 599)

Overview:
A thesis is an intensive research study that contributes new knowledge or understanding to the field of computer science or information systems.
It involves more extensive original research compared to a project.

Requirements:
Credits: Typically requires 6 credits.
Committee Approval: The thesis topic must be approved by a thesis committee consisting of faculty members.
Comprehensive Oral Exam & Defense: Pass both an oral exam on your subject area and successfully defend your thesis before your committee.

Process:
1. Proposal Development: Develop a detailed proposal outlining your intended research question, methodology, and expected contributions to the field.
2. Committee Formation: Assemble a thesis committee for oversight and approval of your work.
3. Research Execution: Conduct thorough research over several semesters; this often includes experiments, data collection, analysis, etc.
4. Thesis Writing & Submission: Write the thesis document according to university guidelines, including drafts reviewed by your advisor/committee.
5. Defense & Final Submission: Defend your thesis in front of the committee; upon successful defense, submit final copies along with any required forms (e.g., Format Approval Sheet).

Key Considerations

1. Time Commitment:
A thesis generally requires more time than a research project due to its scope and depth.

2. Career Goals:
If you plan on pursuing further academic work such as Ph.D., a thesis might be more beneficial as it demonstrates capability in conducting comprehensive independent research.

3. Skills Development:
Both options develop valuable skills but vary in focus—thesis offers deeper engagement with theoretical aspects while projects might offer more direct application scenarios.

4. Interest Area:
Consider what exc


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  The audit notes that no more than 9 credit hours from certain courses (e.g., CSC591, MIS591) can be applied toward my degree. How does this policy affect my course selection and planning?

Assistant: The policy limiting the application of certain courses toward your degree is important for ensuring a well-rounded academic experience and meeting specific program requirements. Here's how this can affect your course selection and planning:

Understanding the Policy
Courses with Limitations: The audit specifies that no more than 9 credit hours from the following courses can be applied toward your degree: CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598.
Reason for Limitation: These courses often include independent studies, research seminars, or internships that provide specialized learning experiences but may not cover a broad range of topics needed for comprehensive knowledge in your field.

Implications for Course Selection

1. Balance Your Credits:
Ensure you are selecting a variety of courses that meet both core requirements and elective needs without exceeding the 9-credit limit from the specified list.
Focus on fulfilling core requirements first before opting to take these limited-credit courses.

2. Strategic Planning:
If you are interested in independent study or internship opportunities (e.g., CSC/MIS 591 or CSC/MIS 598), plan strategically to incorporate them without surpassing the credit cap.
Consider how these experiences align with your career goals and select those most beneficial to you.

3. Diversify Learning:
Choose electives outside of these categories to diversify your learning experience and gain exposure to different areas within computer science or information systems.
This approach will also help ensure compliance with program policies while broadening your skill set.

4. Consultation with Advisors:
Regularly consult with academic advisors to verify that your course selections align with graduation requirements.
They can provide guidance on how best to distribute credits across required and elective courses while adhering to any limitations.

Actionable Steps
Review remaining core course requirements and prioritize enrolling in those as soon as they become available.
Assess which limited-credit courses offer unique benefits like hands-on experience or specialized knowledge relevant to future plans.
Plan semesters ahead by considering availability of desired electives alongside required coursework.
Maintain regular communication with academic advisors regarding progress towards degree completion while adhering to credit restrictions.

By carefully planning around this policy, you can make informed decisions about course enrollment that supports both degree completion and personal educational objectives.

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  If I've taken a course that might meet one of my major requirements but it isn't listed on my audit, what is the process for requesting a substitution or waiver for that course?

Assistant: If you've taken a course that you believe should satisfy one of your major requirements but it isn't reflected in your audit, you can follow a formal process to request a course substitution or waiver. Here's how to proceed:

Steps for Requesting a Course Substitution or Waiver

1. Gather Documentation:
Collect all relevant information about the course, including the syllabus, course description, and any work or projects completed that demonstrate its relevance to the requirement you're aiming to fulfill.

2. Contact Your Academic Advisor:
Schedule a meeting with your academic advisor to discuss your situation. They can provide guidance on whether the course is eligible for substitution and explain the necessary steps in more detail.

3. Prepare a Formal Request:
Draft a formal request letter or form (if available) outlining why you believe the course meets the requirement.
Include supporting documents such as syllabi, transcripts, and any other evidence that highlights alignment with required learning outcomes.

4. Submit Your Request:
Submit your formal request along with all supporting documentation to your department's academic committee or designated officer responsible for reviewing such petitions.
Ensure you adhere to any deadlines and specific submission procedures set by your department.

5. Follow Up:
After submitting your request, follow up periodically with either your advisor or the department contact person to check on the status of your petition.
Be prepared to provide additional information if requested during the review process.

6. Await Decision Notification:
You will be notified of the decision regarding your substitution/waiver request once it has been reviewed.
If approved, ensure that this change is accurately reflected in your degree audit report.

Considerations
Department Policies: Each department may have specific policies regarding substitutions and waivers; familiarize yourself with these guidelines prior to submitting requests.
Impact on Graduation: Understand how any potential changes might affect credit hours needed for graduation and plan accordingly.
Alternative Options: In case of denial, discuss alternative courses or pathways with advisors that would allow fulfillment of outstanding requirements effectively.

By following these steps and maintaining clear communication with university staff throughout this process, you can effectively address discrepancies between coursework completed and major requirements listed in audits.
