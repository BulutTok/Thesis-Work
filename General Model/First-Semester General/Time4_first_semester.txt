Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  How does taking a full-time course load of 9 to 15 hours per semester benefit my progress toward graduation, especially given the credit and GPA requirements outlined in my audit?

Assistant: Taking a full-time course load of 9 to 15 credit hours per semester can significantly benefit your progress toward graduation, especially considering the specific credit and GPA requirements you've outlined in your degree audit. Here’s how:

Benefits of a Full-Time Course Load

1. Faster Completion of Credit Requirements:
Credit Accumulation: Enrolling in 9 to 15 credit hours per semester allows you to accumulate credits more quickly. Since you need a total of 36 credits for your degree and have already completed 12, maintaining a full-time load will help you meet this requirement efficiently.
Regular Progress: By consistently taking courses each semester, you maintain steady progress toward completing your degree requirements.

2. GPA Improvement Opportunities:
More Courses, More Chances: Taking multiple courses provides more opportunities to improve your GPA. Each course is an opportunity to earn high grades, which can help raise your overall GPA closer to or above the required minimum of 3.0.
Balanced Workload: A full-time schedule allows you to balance challenging courses with those that might be less demanding, potentially making it easier to achieve higher grades across the board.

3. Financial Aid and Visa Compliance:
Eligibility for Financial Aid: Many financial aid packages require students to maintain full-time status. Ensuring you're enrolled in at least 9 credit hours can help you remain eligible for any financial assistance.
Visa Requirements: As an international student, maintaining full-time enrollment is often necessary for visa compliance, ensuring there are no interruptions in your study program due to regulatory issues.

4. Engagement and Support:
Academic Engagement: Being enrolled full-time keeps you engaged with the university community, allowing access to academic support services like tutoring and advising.
Networking Opportunities: Full-time students often have more opportunities for networking with peers and faculty through various campus activities and events.

Summary
Maintaining a full-time course load not only accelerates your path towards fulfilling credit requirements but also provides strategic advantages in managing GPA improvements and meeting both financial aid and visa conditions. Balancing this with good time management will be key in maximizing these benefits.
