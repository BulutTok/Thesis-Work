Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  can you help me understand which core courses I should prioritize this semester and how they fit into my overall degree requirements?

Assistant: Certainly! Let's break down your degree requirements and prioritize your core courses for this semester.

Current Academic Status
Credits Completed: 12 out of 36 required.
GPA Requirement: You need to achieve a minimum GPA of 3.0 (currently at 0.000).

Core Course Requirements
You have completed or are currently taking:
CSC 532: Design & Analysis Of Algorithms I
MIS 534: Information Security Management
CSC 550: Software Engineering
MIS 503: Programming for Analytics

Still Needed:
1. CSC 544: Network Programming
2. MIS 555: Database Management Systems
3. MIS 565: Analysis, Modeling and Design

Recommendations

Prioritize These Core Courses:
1. CSC 544 - Network Programming
Essential for completing your core requirements.
   
2. MIS 555 - Database Management Systems
Important for understanding database management which is critical in many computing applications.

3. MIS 565 - Analysis, Modeling and Design
Focuses on methodologies that will be useful in project design and implementation.

Additional Course Options:
Since you also need elective credits, consider these while ensuring no more than nine credits from certain courses (e.g., CSC/MIS 591, CSC/MIS 595) count toward the degree.

Research or Thesis Credits
You need to complete either a research project or thesis (6 credits). Consider planning for these as you progress with your core courses.

Actionable Steps
1. Enroll in CSC 544, MIS 555, and MIS 565 if they are available this semester.
2. Plan your schedule to maintain a balanced workload.
3. Aim to improve your GPA by focusing on understanding course material thoroughly.

Look for available sections of required courses that are offered in person.

Suggested Courses
CSC 544: Network Programming (if available in-person)
MIS 555: Database Management Systems (if available in-person)
MIS 565: Analysis, Modeling and Design (if available in-person)

If any of these courses are not available in-person or don't add up to 6 in-person credits, consider elective courses that meet the requirement.

Additional Steps
Check the course schedule for each class to confirm their instructional method.
Visit [UNCW Full-Time Status](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status) for more information about maintaining full-time status.
