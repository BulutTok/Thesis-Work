Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  What does it mean when my degree audit indicates "0% degree progress" and "0 credits applied," and what steps should I take to begin accumulating credits?

Assistant: Understanding Your Degree Audit

When your degree audit indicates "0% degree progress" and "0 credits applied," it means that you have not yet completed any courses that count towards the credit requirements for your Master of Science degree in Computer Science/Information Systems. This is common for new students who are just beginning their program.

Steps to Begin Accumulating Credits

1. Review Program Requirements:
You need a total of 36 credits to complete your degree.
Ensure you understand the core courses and additional course requirements:
Core Courses Required:
CSC 532: Design and Analysis of Algorithms I
MIS 534: Information Security Management
CSC 544: Network Programming
CSC 550: Software Engineering
MIS 555: Database Management Systems
MIS 565: Analysis, Modeling and Design

2. Plan Your First Semester Courses:
As a new student, it's advisable to start with core courses required for your major.
Consider enrolling in one or more of the following:
CSC 532 if available (Design and Analysis of Algorithms I)
MIS 534 if available (Information Security Management)

3. Consider Course Prerequisites and Availability:
Some courses may have prerequisites; ensure you meet them before enrolling.
Check the course schedule for availability during your desired semester.

4. Register for Courses:
Use SeaNet or consult with your academic advisor to register for courses.
Make sure to enroll in at least nine credit hours per semester if you're an international student needing full-time status.

5. Consult Your Academic Advisor:
Meet with your academic advisor to discuss your academic plan, ensuring it aligns with degree requirements and personal goals.
   
6. Explore Research or Thesis Options Early On: 
Decide whether you want to pursue a research project (CSC/MIS 594) or thesis (CSC/MIS 599).
Plan accordingly as these require approval and planning over multiple semesters.

7. Maintain Good Academic Standing: 
    – Aim for at least a GPA of 3.0, as this is required for graduation.

8. Utilize University Resources: 
    – Take advantage of tutoring services, workshops, and other resources offered by UNCW to support your studies.

Conclusion

By taking these steps, you'll be well on your way toward accumulating credits needed for graduation. Always keep track of progress through regular consultations with advisors and by frequently checking updates on SeaNet regarding course offerings each semester.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  With 36 credits required for graduation and specific core course requirements (e.g., CSC 532, MIS 534, CSC 544, CSC 550, MIS 555, MIS 565), how should I plan my schedule to satisfy these academic requirements?

Assistant: Planning Your Course Schedule

To efficiently satisfy your academic requirements for the Master of Science degree in Computer Science/Information Systems, it's important to strategically plan your course schedule. Here's a suggested approach:

MIS Courses:
MIS 534 if available (Information Security Management)
MIS 565 if available (Analysis, Modeling and Design)

Step 4: Incorporate Additional Electives
You need an additional set of elective courses from the range CSC/MIS/BAN to reach a total of at least twelve more credits.
Select electives that align with your career goals or areas you wish to specialize in.

Step 5: Consider Research or Thesis Options Early On 
Decide between pursuing a research project or thesis early as it requires planning.
Enroll in corresponding courses like CSC/MIS594 or CSC/MIS599 after consulting with faculty advisors.

Step6 : Monitor Prerequisites & Availability 
– Check prerequisites for each course and ensure they are met.
– Confirm course availability through SeaNet each semester prior to registration.

Conclusion

By following this structured approach, you'll be able to fulfill all core requirements while maintaining flexibility in exploring additional topics through electives. Regular consultation with academic advisors will further ensure that any adjustments needed are made timely based on course offerings each semester.


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  The degree audit notes that my current GPA is below the minimum 3.0 requirement—what are the consequences of this, and how can I improve my academic standing?

Assistant: Understanding the Consequences of a GPA Below 3.0

Having a GPA below the minimum requirement of 3.0 can have several implications:

1. Academic Probation: 
You may be placed on academic probation, which is a formal warning that your academic performance must improve.
   
2. Impact on Financial Aid:
Falling below the required GPA can affect eligibility for certain scholarships or financial aid.

3. Graduation Eligibility:
You must achieve at least a 3.0 GPA to graduate from your program.

4. Program Continuation:
Continued low performance could lead to dismissal from the program if not addressed.

Steps to Improve Your Academic Standing

1. Evaluate Current Performance:
Identify courses where you struggled and understand why (e.g., difficulty with material, time management issues).

2. Seek Academic Support:
Utilize tutoring services offered by the university.
Attend workshops focused on study skills and time management.

3. Meet with an Academic Advisor:
Discuss your current challenges and develop a plan to address them.
Advisors can provide guidance on course selection and workload balance.

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  How does the audit differentiate between the research project option (CSC 594/MIS 594) and the thesis option (CSC 599/MIS 599), and what requirements must be completed for each pathway?

Assistant: Differentiation Between Research Project and Thesis Options

Your degree audit outlines two distinct pathways for completing your research requirement: the Research Project option (CSC 594/MIS 594) and the Thesis option (CSC 599/MIS 599). Each pathway has its own set of requirements:

Research Project Option (CSC 594/MIS 594)
Credits Required: 
You need to complete a total of 6 credits in either CSC 594 or MIS 594.
Requirements:
Final Project: Successfully complete a final research project.
This involves selecting a research topic, conducting thorough investigation, analysis, and presenting findings.
The project typically culminates in a written report or paper.
Defense of Project: Successfully defend the research project.
A formal presentation where you explain your methodology, results, and conclusions to a committee.
Feedback from the committee will be integral to final approval.

Thesis Option (CSC 599/MIS 599)
Credits Required:
You need to complete a total of 6 credits in either CSC 599 or MIS 599.
Requirements:
Comprehensive Oral Exam: Pass a comprehensive oral exam related to your thesis work.
Thesis Defense Requirement: Successfully defend your thesis before a committee.
Similar to the research project defense but often more rigorous due to the depth of work involved in a thesis.
Draft Thesis Submission: Submit an electronic draft of your thesis by the specified deadline. 

   – Must include:
Draft submission electronically
Format Approval Sheet
Final submission with all necessary signatures
Additional Documents:
   – ETD Submission Form is required upon completion

Choosing Between Options

1. Research Interests & Goals:
If you prefer practical applications and shorter-term projects, consider the Research Project option.
If you are interested in deep academic inquiry or considering doctoral studies, the Thesis option may be more suitable.

2. Consultation with Advisors:
   – Discuss both options with faculty advisors who can provide insights into what each entails based on past student experiences within UNCW's program structure.

3. Time Commitment & Resources:
   – Consider available time commitment as theses generally require more extended periods due to their comprehensive nature compared with projects that tend toward applied learning outcomes over shorter durations!

By understanding these differences clearly along with associated requirements per path chosen at UNCW’s graduate level programs; it becomes easier making informed decisions aligning best personal career aspirations alongside institutional expectations!
