Managing Real-Time Feedback in Asynchronous Courses

Asynchronous courses like MIS505 typically manage real-time feedback through several strategies and tools, even though they do not involve live sessions. Here are common approaches that might be used:

1. Discussion Forums:
Instructors often utilize discussion boards where students can post questions and receive feedback from peers and the instructor. These forums are monitored regularly to ensure timely responses.

2. Scheduled Office Hours:
Instructors may offer virtual office hours via video conferencing platforms (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams) where students can drop in for immediate feedback and assistance on course material.

3. Email Communication:
Direct email communication with the instructor is another channel for obtaining feedback. Instructors typically specify response time expectations to ensure students receive timely support.

4. Feedback on Assignments:
Assignments submitted through a learning management system (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard) often come with detailed feedback from instructors, which helps guide student learning effectively.

5. Automated Feedback Tools:
Some courses employ automated tools within quizzes or assignments that provide instant feedback based on student inputs, helping them understand mistakes immediately.

6. Peer Review Mechanisms:
Peer reviews of projects or assignments encourage interaction among students and provide additional perspectives and feedback on their work.

Conclusion

While MIS505 is an asynchronous course, it likely employs a combination of these strategies to facilitate effective real-time feedback for students. For specific details about how real-time feedback is managed in this course, reviewing the syllabus or contacting the instructor directly would provide more precise information tailored to this particular offering.
