Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  What are the university policies regarding full-time enrollment for graduate students, and how might that affect my progress toward completing the 36 required credits?

Assistant: University Policies on Full-Time Enrollment for Graduate Students

1. Full-Time Status Requirements:
To be considered a full-time graduate student, you must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
For international students, it's important to take at least 6 of these credit hours in-person to meet visa requirements.

2. Continuous Enrollment:
If you have completed all coursework but need to finish your capstone or thesis, you can maintain your enrollment status by registering for continuous enrollment through the [Graduate School Forms](https://uncw.edu/myuncw/academics/graduate-school/forms).

3. Capstone/Thesis Hours:
Typically, students register for 3 capstone or thesis hours per semester. This allows time for proposal work one semester and completion or defense the next.

Impact on Progress Toward Degree Completion
Credit Accumulation: Enrolling as a full-time student will enable you to accumulate credits more quickly, potentially allowing you to complete your degree within two years if you maintain this pace.
Balanced Workload: By taking a mix of core courses and electives each semester, you'll not only fulfill degree requirements but also gain diverse skills applicable to your career goals.
Maintaining Visa Status (for International Students): Adhering to the full-time enrollment policy is crucial for maintaining legal student status in the U.S., which impacts both academic progress and post-graduation opportunities.

Recommendations
Plan each semester carefully to ensure you're meeting full-time status while balancing course difficulty.
Consider how elective choices align with career aspirations and enhance your core knowledge base.
Regularly consult with an academic advisor to stay on track with degree requirements and explore any available research or internship opportunities that complement your studies.

By understanding and following these policies, you'll be well-positioned to efficiently progress toward completing your 36-credit requirement while gaining valuable experience along the way. If you have further questions about specific policies or need assistance planning future semesters, don't hesitate to reach out!


Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  I’m also considering my options for the final project credits—opting for either a research project or a thesis. Could you walk me through the key differences and the process for each option?

Assistant: Certainly! Choosing between a research project and a thesis is an important decision that can influence your academic experience and career trajectory. Here’s a breakdown of the key differences and processes for each option:

Research Project vs. Thesis: Key Differences

Research Project (CSC 594 or MIS 594)

Ask about courses (or type 'exit' to quit):  I see there’s a restriction on applying more than 9 credit hours from courses like CSC 591, MIS 591, etc. Could you explain how these restrictions work and how they impact my course planning?

Assistant: Understanding Credit Hour Restrictions

The restriction you mentioned is an important consideration in your course planning. Here's how it works and what it means for your academic journey:

Restricted Courses
Courses Included: The restriction applies to the following courses:
CSC 591 / MIS 591 (Directed Independent Study)
CSC 595 / MIS 595 (Research Seminar)
CSC 598 / MIS 598 (Internship)
Credit Limit: You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from these courses toward the completion of your degree.

Impact on Course Planning

1. Diverse Learning Experience:
This restriction encourages you to take a variety of courses, ensuring a broad educational experience rather than concentrating too heavily on independent study or internships.
It ensures that you gain exposure to structured coursework that covers essential topics and methodologies within your field.

2. Strategic Course Selection:
Plan your schedule by prioritizing core and elective courses that fulfill degree requirements outside these restricted credits.
Consider using directed independent study or internships strategically to complement specific career goals or areas where hands-on experience is beneficial.

3. Maximizing Opportunities:
Use the allowed credits for directed studies or internships when they provide unique opportunities not available through regular coursework, such as specialized research projects or industry partnerships.
Balance these with required core courses like algorithms, security management, network programming, etc., to build foundational knowledge.

4. Consultation with Advisors:
Regularly consult with academic advisors to ensure you're meeting all graduation requirements while taking full advantage of the learning opportunities offered by these experiences.
Discuss potential research ideas or internship placements early to align them with both personal interests and degree constraints.

Conclusion

By understanding this credit hour restriction, you can effectively plan your curriculum to meet all program requirements while gaining diverse skills and experiences necessary for success in computer science/information systems.
