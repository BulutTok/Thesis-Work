Assistant: Understanding Your Course Schedule and Visa Requirements

I understand your concern about maintaining your visa status while keeping up with your academic progress. Let's break down the requirements and steps you need to follow:

Full-Time Enrollment Requirements
As an international student, you must maintain full-time enrollment to comply with visa regulations. Here’s what that typically means:
Minimum Credit Hours: You need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Classes: At least 6 of these credit hours should be from in-person courses.

For more detailed information, you can refer to [UNCW's Full-Time Status Requirements](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

Current Course Structure
Based on the course data and degree audit:
You are currently enrolled in 12 credit hours for Spring 2025, all of which are in-progress.
Courses include CSC 532, CSC 550, MIS 503, and MIS 534.
Ensure that at least two of these courses meet the in-person requirement if any are online.

Prerequisites and Academic Progress
Here's a brief overview of prerequisites relevant to your program:
For some advanced courses like MIS 506 (Text and Unstructured Data Analytics), having completed MIS 503 is necessary.
Keep track of any prerequisite chains to avoid delays in your studies.

Additional Steps for Compliance
1. Regular Meetings with Your Advisor: Schedule regular meetings with your academic advisor to ensure you're on track both academically and with visa requirements.
2. Documentation: Always have updated documentation regarding your enrollment status handy. This includes proof of full-time enrollment each semester.
3. Continuous Communication: Stay informed about any changes in immigration policies by regularly checking updates from UNCW’s International Student Services.

Summary
To maintain both academic progress and visa compliance:
Enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester, ensuring at least 6 are in-person.
Monitor prerequisites for upcoming courses.
Regularly consult with advisors and keep documentation updated.
