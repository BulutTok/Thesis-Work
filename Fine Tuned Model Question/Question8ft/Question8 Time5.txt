Assistant: I understand how important it is to balance your academic and visa requirements. Let’s go through the steps to make sure everything is in order.

Ensuring Full-Time Status

Academic Requirements:
Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Requirement: At least 6 of these credits should be from in-person classes.

For Spring 2025, you’re enrolled in:
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithms (3 credits)
CSC 550 - Software Engineering (3 credits)
MIS 503 - Programming for Analytics (3 credits)
MIS 534 - Information Security Management (3 credits)

This totals 12 credits, fulfilling the full-time enrollment requirement.

Prerequisites and Course Planning

Make sure you meet the prerequisites for each course:
If a course requires multiple prerequisites, meeting even one allows you to enroll.

Additional Steps

1. Advisor Meetings: Regularly meet with your academic advisor to ensure you're on track and address any concerns early.

2. GPA Monitoring: Maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 as required by your program.

3. Documentation: Keep all necessary documents updated, including enrollment verification and visa paperwork.

4. University Resources: Reach out to the international office for any immigration-related questions or assistance with documentation.
