Ensuring Full-Time Status

Academic Requirements:
Credit Hours: You need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Requirement: At least 6 of these credit hours must be in-person classes.

For Spring 2025, you're enrolled in:
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithms (3 credits)
CSC 550 - Software Engineering (3 credits)

This totals 12 credits, which meets the full-time enrollment requirement.

Prerequisites and Course Planning
Review course prerequisites to ensure eligibility.
If a course has multiple prerequisites, meeting just one allows you to enroll.
