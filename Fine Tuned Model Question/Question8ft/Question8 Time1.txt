Assistant: Understanding Your Course Schedule and Visa Requirements

I understand your concerns, and I'm here to help guide you through this process. Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. Full-Time Status Requirements

As an international student, maintaining full-time status is crucial for your visa. Here’s what you need to do:
Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Requirement: At least 6 of those credit hours should be from in-person courses.

For more details on maintaining full-time status, you can refer to the [UNCW Full-Time Status Information](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status).

2. Current Academic Progress

Based on your current course enrollment:
You're taking CSC 532, CSC 550, MIS 503, and MIS 534.
These courses add up to 12 credits for Spring 2025.

This meets the full-time requirement for both academic progress and immigration purposes.

3. Prerequisites and Course Planning

To ensure you're meeting prerequisites:
Check each course description for specific prerequisites.
If you meet at least one prerequisite for a multi-requisite course, you're eligible to enroll.

4. Additional Steps
Monitor GPA: Aim for a minimum GPA of 3.0 as required by your program.
Regular Advising: Schedule regular meetings with your academic advisor to ensure you're on track with both academic requirements and visa regulations.

Conclusion

You're currently meeting all necessary requirements for both your degree progress and visa status this semester. However, continuous monitoring is key. If any issues arise or if there are changes in your schedule or status, reach out immediately to both your academic advisor and the international office.
