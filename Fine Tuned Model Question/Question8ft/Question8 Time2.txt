Assistant: I understand that managing your academic progress while maintaining visa status can be stressful. Let's go through the details to ensure everything is in order.

Maintaining Full-Time Status

Academic Requirements:
Credit Hours: You need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Classes: At least 6 of these credit hours should be from in-person classes.

Currently, you're enrolled in the following courses for Spring 2025:
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithms (3 credits)
CSC 550 - Software Engineering (3 credits)
MIS 503 - Programming for Analytics (3 credits)
MIS 534 - Information Security Management (3 credits)

This totals 12 credits, meeting both full-time and visa requirements.

Prerequisites and Course Planning

Make sure you review each course's prerequisites to stay eligible:
If a course has multiple prerequisites, meeting even one qualifies you for enrollment.
  
Additional Steps

1. Regular Advisor Meetings: Stay in touch with your academic advisor to monitor your progress and address any issues promptly.
   
2. GPA Monitoring: Ensure your GPA is at or above the required minimum of 3.0 for your program.

3. Documentation: Keep all necessary documentation updated and accessible, such as enrollment verification and any correspondence related to your visa status.

4. Resources: Utilize university resources like the international office if you have specific questions about immigration policies or need assistance with paperwork.
