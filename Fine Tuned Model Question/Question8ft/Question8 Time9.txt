Assistant: Understanding Your Academic and Immigration Requirements

I understand that managing both your academic progress and visa status can be stressful. Let's break it down step by step to make sure you're on track.

1. Full-Time Status for International Students
To maintain full-time status, you need at least 9 credit hours per semester.
At least 6 of those credits must be from in-person courses.
For detailed information, refer to the [UNCW Full-Time Status](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status) page.

2. Current Course Enrollment
You are currently enrolled in:
CSC 532 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms I) – 3 credits
CSC 550 (Software Engineering) – 3 credits
MIS 503 (Programming for Analytics) – 3 credits
MIS 534 (Information Security Management) – 3 credits
   
   These add up to a total of 12 credit hours, which maintains your full-time status.

3. Prerequisites and Course Planning
Make sure to meet prerequisites for future courses. For example:
CSC 544 (Network Programming)
MIS 555 (Database Management Systems)
MIS 565 (Analysis, Modeling, and Design)

4. Academic Progress
You have completed 12 out of the required 36 credit hours.
Ensure a minimum GPA of 3.0 to meet program requirements.

Steps Forward:
Review your course plan with an advisor each semester to ensure you’re meeting both academic and visa requirements.
Stay informed about any changes in immigration policies that may affect your studies.
Keep copies of all enrollment documents as proof of your full-time student status.

If you have further concerns or need personalized advice, consider reaching out directly to the international student office or your academic advisor. They can provide additional support tailored to your situation.
