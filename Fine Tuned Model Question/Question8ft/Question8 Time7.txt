Assistant: Certainly! It's understandable to be concerned about maintaining your visa status while managing your academic progress. Let's break down the steps you need to take to ensure you remain a full-time student and meet both academic and immigration requirements.

Full-Time Status Requirements

1. Credit Hours: As an international graduate student, you need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
2. In-Person Courses: At least 6 of these credit hours must be from courses that are in-person or have a face-to-face component.

Course Schedule Planning
Current Courses: You are already enrolled in:
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithm
CSC 550 - Software Engineering
MIS 503 - Programming for Analytics
MIS 534 - Information Security Management
  
These courses provide a total of 12 credits, meeting the requirement for full-time status this semester.
Upcoming Prerequisites: Ensure that any upcoming courses you plan to take meet their prerequisites. For example:
CSC 544 (Network Programming) requires completion before moving forward with related advanced topics.

Academic Progress
Degree Requirements: You need a total of 36 credits for your degree, with certain core courses and electives still required.
GPA Requirement: Aim for a minimum GPA of 3.0 to fulfill graduation requirements.

Additional Steps

1. Consult Your Academic Advisor: Regular meetings can help align your course selection with both academic goals and visa requirements.
2. Documentation: Keep all documentation updated, including proof of enrollment and any required forms from the Graduate School website.
3. Continuous Enrollment: If you're nearing program completion but not taking formal classes, consider registering for continuous enrollment if needed.

If you have specific questions about documentation or further concerns regarding immigration compliance, it's best to consult with the International Student Office at UNCW for personalized guidance.
