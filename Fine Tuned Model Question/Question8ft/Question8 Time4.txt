Assistant: I understand that balancing academic and visa requirements can be challenging, but I'm here to help you through it. Let’s review what you need to do:

Maintaining Full-Time Status

Academic Requirements:
Credit Hours: You must enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
In-Person Requirement: At least 6 of these credits should be from in-person courses.

For Spring 2025, your current enrollment is:
CSC 532 - Design & Analysis Of Algorithms (3 credits)
CSC 550 - Software Engineering (3 credits)
MIS 503 - Programming for Analytics (3 credits)
MIS 534 - Information Security Management (3 credits)

This totals 12 credits, satisfying the full-time requirement.

Prerequisites and Course Planning
Ensure you meet the prerequisites for each course. If a course has multiple prerequisites, meeting even one allows you to enroll.

Additional Steps

1. Advisor Meetings: Regularly consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're on track and address any issues early.

2. GPA Monitoring: Keep an eye on your GPA, aiming for at least a 3.0 as required by your program.

3. Documentation: Maintain updated records of enrollment verification and any visa-related documents.

4. University Resources: Utilize the international office for assistance with immigration queries or paperwork.
