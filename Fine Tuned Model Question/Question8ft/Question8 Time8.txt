Assistant: Understanding Full-Time Status and Academic Progress

I understand your concern, and I'm here to help you navigate both your academic and immigration requirements. Let's break this down step by step:

1. Full-Time Enrollment Requirements:
As an international student, you need to enroll in at least 9 credit hours per semester.
At least 6 of these credit hours should be in-person classes.
You can refer to the [full-time status policy](https://catalogue.uncw.edu/content.php?catoid=74&navoid=10022&hl=%22full+time%22&returnto=search#Full-Time_Status) for more details.

2. Current Academic Progress:

Based on your degree audit:
You are currently enrolled in 12 credits for Spring 2025, which maintains your full-time status.
Your courses include CSC 532, CSC 550, MIS 503, and MIS 534—all progressing toward your degree.

3. Prerequisite Considerations:

You’ve met the prerequisites for your current courses:
CSC 532 requires completion of CSC 500, which you've satisfied.
Continue monitoring any future prerequisites to ensure timely enrollment in subsequent courses.

Steps to Ensure Compliance:

1. Maintain Enrollment:
Always register for at least the minimum required credit hours each semester.
   
2. Monitor Course Modalities:
Ensure that at least two-thirds of your courses are in-person if you're taking online classes.

3. Stay Updated with Visa Requirements:
Keep regular contact with the International Office to stay informed about any changes or additional documentation needed for maintaining your visa status.

4. Consult Your Academic Advisor Regularly:
They can provide personalized advice and help you adjust your course plan if necessary.

5. Apply for Graduation on Time:
Don’t forget to apply through SeaNet when you're close to completing your degree requirements.
