Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on Credits and GPA

1. Course Repeatability: 
Most courses in your program cannot be repeated for credit, as indicated by "Course may not be repeated" in their descriptions.
If you must retake a course due to an unsatisfactory grade, the new grade will replace the old one in calculating your GPA.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
Repeating a course does not increase your total credit count towards graduation since you only earn credits once for a course.
Ensure that retaking a course does not exceed any limits on elective or core courses.

3. Impact on GPA:
The most recent grade received in a repeated course will be used to calculate your GPA.
Improving your grade can help raise your overall GPA, which is essential as you need at least a 3.0 to meet graduation requirements.

Recommendations
Consultation: Discuss with your academic advisor before deciding to repeat any course.
Focus Areas: Prioritize courses critical to meeting prerequisites or advancing in your major.

Conclusion

Repeating a course can improve your GPA but won't add additional credits toward graduation requirements. Always seek guidance from an advisor to align this decision with your academic goals.
