Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on Credits and GPA

1. Repeatability of Courses:
Most courses in your program are not repeatable for additional credit unless specified otherwise. If you do not achieve the required grade, you may need to retake the course to meet your degree requirements.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
Retaking a course does not add extra credits towards your degree if it is not repeatable for credit. The new grade will replace the old one in terms of GPA calculation but will not increase your total credit count.

3. Impact on GPA:
When you retake a course, the most recent grade usually replaces the previous one in your GPA calculation, which can help improve your overall GPA if you perform better.

Recommendations
Consult Your Advisor: Discuss with your academic advisor before deciding to retake any course.
Focus on Improvement: Utilize available resources like tutoring or study groups to improve performance when repeating a course.
Plan Ahead: Ensure that retaking a course fits into your schedule without delaying graduation.

Summary

Retaking a course can help improve your GPA if needed, but be mindful that it won't contribute additional credits toward graduation requirements. Always consult with an advisor for personalized guidance based on your specific situation.
