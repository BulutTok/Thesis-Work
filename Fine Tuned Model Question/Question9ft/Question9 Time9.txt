Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on GPA

1. Repeatability: Most courses listed in your program are not repeatable. If a course is repeatable, it will be specified in the course details.

2. Effect on Credit Count:
When you repeat a course, the credits from the repeated attempt typically do not count towards your total credit requirement for graduation if they were already counted from the first attempt.
Only one set of credits for a particular course counts toward your degree requirements.

3. Impact on GPA:
The most recent grade usually replaces the previous grade in your GPA calculation, but all attempts may appear on your transcript.
Repeating a course can help improve your GPA if you earn a higher grade the second time.

Recommendations
Check Repeat Policy: Verify whether specific courses can be repeated by reviewing their details or consulting with an academic advisor.
Strategic Repetition: Consider repeating courses where improving your grade would significantly impact your GPA.
Consultation: Discuss with an academic advisor to understand how repeating a course aligns with graduation requirements and impacts financial aid eligibility.
