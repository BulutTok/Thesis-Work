Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on Credits and GPA

1. Course Repeatability:
Most courses in your program cannot be repeated for credit, meaning if you retake a course, it won't add to your total credit count.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
Retaking a course does not increase the number of credits applied toward your degree since repeated courses do not contribute additional credits.

3. Impact on GPA:
When you repeat a course, the new grade can replace the previous one in calculating your GPA. This means that improving your grade in a repeated course can help raise your overall GPA.

Recommendations
Check Specific Course Policies: Verify whether the specific course you wish to retake allows for repetition.
Focus on Improvement: If allowed to repeat, aim for a higher grade to positively impact your GPA.
Consult with Advisor: Discuss with an academic advisor how repeating the course will fit into your overall academic plan.
