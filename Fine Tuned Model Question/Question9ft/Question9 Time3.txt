Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on GPA

Repeating Courses:
Repeatable Courses: Most courses in your program cannot be repeated unless specifically allowed. Check the course details to confirm.

Impact on Credits and GPA:
Credits: If you repeat a course, only the most recent grade will count towards your GPA, but both attempts will appear on your transcript.
GPA Calculation: The latest attempt's grade replaces the previous one in GPA calculations, which can improve your GPA if you earn a higher grade.

Recommendations:
1. Check Course Policies: Confirm each course's repeatability policy to see if repeating is possible.
2. Consult with Advisor: Discuss how retaking a course could impact your academic plan and graduation timeline.
3. Improvement Strategies: Consider tutoring or study groups before retaking a course.

Conclusion
Repeating a course can help improve your GPA but won't add additional credits towards degree completion if both attempts are counted separately for credit requirements. Always consult with an academic advisor for personalized guidance.
