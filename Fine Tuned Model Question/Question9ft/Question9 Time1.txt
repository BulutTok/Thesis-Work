Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on GPA

Repeating Courses:
Repeatable Courses: Each course has specific repeatability rules. Most courses in your program cannot be repeated unless specified otherwise.
  
Impact on Credits and GPA:
Credits: If you repeat a course, only the most recent grade will count towards your GPA, but both attempts may appear on your transcript.
GPA Calculation: The latest attempt's grade replaces the previous one in GPA calculations, potentially improving your GPA if you earn a higher grade.

Recommendations:
1. Review Course Policies: Check each courseâ€™s repeatability policy to see if repeating is allowed.
2. Consult with Advisor: Discuss how repeating a course could affect your academic plan and graduation timeline.
3. Focus on Performance Improvement: Consider strategies for improvement, such as tutoring or study groups, before deciding to retake a course.

Conclusion
Repeating a course can help improve your GPA but won't add additional credits towards degree completion if both attempts are counted separately in terms of credit requirements. Always consult with an academic advisor for personalized guidance.
