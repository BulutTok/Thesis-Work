Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on GPA

Repeating Courses:
Repeatable Courses: Most courses in your program cannot be repeated unless specified otherwise. You should check the specific course details to confirm.

Impact on Credits and GPA:
Credits: When you repeat a course, only the most recent grade is used for your GPA calculation, but both attempts will appear on your transcript.
GPA Calculation: The new grade replaces the previous one in the GPA calculation, which can help improve your GPA if you earn a higher grade.

Recommendations:
1. Check Course Policies: Verify each course's repeatability policy to determine if repeating is an option.
2. Consult with Advisor: Discuss potential impacts on your academic plan and graduation timeline.
3. Improvement Strategies: Consider additional support like tutoring or study groups before retaking a course.

Conclusion
Repeating a course can positively affect your GPA but won't add extra credits towards degree completion since only the latest attempt counts for credit. Always seek advice from an academic advisor for personalized guidance.
