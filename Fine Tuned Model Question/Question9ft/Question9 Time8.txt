Assistant: Course Repeatability and Impact on GPA

1. Course Repeatability:
Most courses in your program may not be repeated unless specified otherwise.
Check the specific course details for repeatability rules.

2. Impact on Credit Count:
If you repeat a course, only the credits from the successful attempt will count toward your degree requirements.
Credits from previous attempts will not contribute to your total credit requirement.

3. Impact on GPA:
The most recent grade received in a repeated course is typically used in calculating your GPA.
Previous grades remain on your transcript but do not affect the cumulative GPA after a successful repeat.

Actionable Steps:
Review each course's repeat policy in your program catalog or consult with an academic advisor.
Focus on improving study strategies and seek additional support if needed to meet grade requirements.

Conclusion

Repeating a course can help improve your GPA if you achieve a better grade, but it won't add extra credits towards your degree beyond the required amount. Always check specific policies related to your program.
