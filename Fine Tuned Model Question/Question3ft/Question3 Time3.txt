Assistant: Certainly! The limitation on the number of credit hours from specific courses like CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 is designed to ensure a balanced academic experience. Here's how it works:

Understanding the Credit Hour Limitation

1. Courses Included:
The courses affected by this limit are typically those that involve independent study (CSC/MIS 591), research seminars (CSC/MIS 595), and internships (CSC/MIS 598).

2. Credit Hour Cap:
You can apply up to a maximum of 9 credit hours from these courses toward your total degree requirements.

3. Purpose of the Limitation:
This restriction ensures that students engage in a comprehensive curriculum that includes both core academic coursework and specialized or practical learning experiences.
It encourages students to gain foundational knowledge through structured courses while also exploring individualized learning opportunities.

4. Planning Your Course Load:
Strategically select which of these limited-credit courses best align with your academic goals and professional aspirations.
Ensure you balance these selections with required core classes to meet all graduation criteria effectively.

5. Impact on Graduation Requirements:
If you exceed the limit of 9 credits in these categories, any additional credits will not count towards fulfilling the minimum credit requirement for graduation.
Plan accordingly to avoid taking more than the allowed credits in these categories unless they are purely for personal enrichment or additional learning outside degree requirements.

Summary
The cap on these types of courses is meant to provide a well-rounded educational experience by combining traditional coursework with opportunities for independent study and real-world application through internships. It's essential to plan your course selections carefully to ensure compliance with this rule while achieving your academic and career objectives.
