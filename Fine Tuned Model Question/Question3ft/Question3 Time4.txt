Assistant: Certainly! In your program, you can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from the following courses toward your degree:
CSC 591 / MIS 591: Directed Independent Study
CSC 595 / MIS 595: Research Seminar
CSC 598 / MIS 598: Internship

These courses are designed to provide flexible learning opportunities, such as independent research, seminars on specific topics, or practical experience through internships. However, the program limits these to ensure that you gain a broad and comprehensive education across core and elective subjects.

Actionable Steps:

1. Plan Your Courses: Consider how many credits you've already taken in these categories.
2. Consult with Advisor: Discuss with your academic advisor how best to incorporate these credits into your study plan without exceeding the limit.
3. Diversify Your Learning: Focus on taking other required and elective courses that complement these experiences.

Summary:
You can include up to 9 credit hours from CSC/MIS 591, 595, and 598 in your degree requirements. This allows for some customization while ensuring a well-rounded curriculum.
