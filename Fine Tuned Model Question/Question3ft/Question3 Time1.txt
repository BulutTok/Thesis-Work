Assistant: Certainly! Here's a breakdown of how the credit hour limitation works for those courses:

Explanation
Credit Hour Limit: You can apply a maximum of 9 credit hours from the specified courses (CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598) towards your degree requirements.
Purpose: These courses often involve independent study, research seminars, or internships. The limit ensures that students have a balanced curriculum with core and elective courses.

Actionable Steps

1. Review Current Credits: Check how many credits you've already taken or plan to take from these specific courses.

2. Plan Remaining Courses:
If you have not reached the 9-credit limit in these areas and find them beneficial, you can consider taking more.
Balance these with other required core or elective courses to ensure diverse learning experiences.

3. Consult Your Advisor: Discuss your academic plan with your advisor to align it with graduation requirements and career goals.

Summary

Make sure that no more than 9 credits from these types of courses are counted towards your total degree requirement of 36 credits. Balancing them with other coursework will help you meet all necessary conditions for graduation.
