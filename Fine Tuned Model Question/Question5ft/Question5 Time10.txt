Assistant: Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the research project and thesis options, along with their key milestones:

Research Project

Purpose:  
Focused study of a practical application in computer science or information systems.
Emphasizes applied research under faculty guidance.

Key Milestones:
1. Project Selection: Choose a topic with faculty and graduate coordinator approval.
2. Research & Analysis: Conduct research and analyze findings.
3. Written Report: Prepare a detailed written analysis of the project.
4. Oral Presentation (DEFN): Successfully defend the project before a committee.
5. Completion (PROJ): Finalize any additional requirements as directed by your advisor.

Thesis

Purpose:  
In-depth, original research study on a selected topic in computer science or information systems.
Suitable for students interested in pursuing further academic research or Ph.D. studies.

Key Milestones:
1. Thesis Proposal: Develop and submit a proposal outlining your intended research.
2. Research & Drafting (DRAT): Conduct thorough research and prepare an initial draft of the thesis.
3. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Submit this sheet along with your draft for formatting approval.
4. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral exam to demonstrate comprehensive knowledge in your field.
5. Thesis Defense (DEFN): Defend your thesis before a committee to validate your findings and methodology.
6. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Submit the final, revised version of your thesis electronically by the deadline.
7. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL) & ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Submit these forms as part of the final submission process.

Conclusion

Both options require you to be enrolled during your graduation semester and to apply for graduation through SeaNet by the deadline.

Consider choosing based on your career goals: opt for a thesis if you're inclined towards academia or further research; choose a project if you're focused on practical applications in industry.

If you have further questions about selecting between these options or need more specific advice, consulting with your academic advisor would be beneficial!
