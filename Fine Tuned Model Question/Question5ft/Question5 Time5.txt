Assistant: Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the differences between the research project and thesis options, along with their key milestones:

Research Project

Overview:
A research project typically involves applying theoretical knowledge to a practical problem.
It's more focused on application rather than generating new knowledge.

Key Milestones:
1. Project Proposal: Develop and submit a proposal outlining your project's scope, objectives, and methodology.
2. Conduct Research: Implement your project plan, collect data, and analyze results.
3. Final Project Report: Write a comprehensive report detailing your findings and conclusions.
4. Defense of Project (DEFN): Present and defend your project before a committee.
5. Completion (PROJ): Successfully complete all components of the project.

Thesis

Overview:
A thesis is more academic in nature, involving original research that contributes to existing knowledge in the field.
It usually requires more extensive research and analysis compared to a project.

Key Milestones:
1. Draft Thesis (DRAT): Submit an initial draft of your thesis for review by the Graduate School.
2. Format Approval Sheet (FORM): Obtain approval for the format of your thesis.
3. Thesis Defense Requirement (DEFN): Defend your thesis orally before a committee.
4. Comprehensive Oral Exam (COMO): Pass an oral exam covering your research area.
5. Final Thesis Submission (THES): Submit the final version of your thesis electronically by the deadline.
6. Signed Thesis Title Page (TITL): Include a signed title page with the final submission.
7. ETD Submission Form (ETDF): Complete an Electronic Thesis Form submission.

Conclusion
Both options require rigorous work but differ in focus and depth. Choose based on whether you're interested in practical application or contributing new knowledge through detailed research.
