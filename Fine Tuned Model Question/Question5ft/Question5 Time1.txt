Assistant: Certainly! Let's break down the differences between the research project and thesis options, along with their key milestones:

Research Project

Overview:
A practical application of computer science or information systems.
Focuses on a specific topic under faculty guidance.

Key Milestones:
1. Selection and Approval: 
Choose a research topic with faculty approval.
2. Written Analysis and Presentation:
Complete a written analysis of your findings.
Present your project orally to demonstrate understanding.
3. Defense:
Successfully defend your research project (DEFN).

Completion Requirements:
Must successfully complete the final project (PROJ).
Typically involves 6 credits, which you are currently working on.

Thesis

Overview:
An in-depth research study contributing new knowledge to the field.
Requires more extensive writing and formal defense.

Key Milestones:
1. Comprehensive Oral Exam: 
Pass a comprehensive written exam (COMO).
2. Thesis Defense: 
Defend your thesis orally before a committee (DEFN).
3. Draft Submission: 
Submit an electronic draft of your thesis by the deadline (DRAT).
4. Format Approval Sheet: 
Submit this sheet along with your draft for format verification (FORM).
5. Final Submission: 
Submit the final version electronically by the deadline (THES).
6. Signed Title Page: 
Include a signed title page with the final submission (TITL).
7. ETD Submission Form: 
Complete and submit this form with your final thesis (ETDF).

Completion Requirements:
Involves intensive research, usually over multiple semesters.

Summary
The *research project* is typically more applied and less extensive than a thesis, focusing on practical applications.
The *thesis* is more comprehensive, often involving original research that contributes to academic knowledge.
Both require defense presentations but differ in depth and scope.

Choosing between them depends on your career goals, whether you prefer practical application or academic research, and how much time you can dedicate to each option.
