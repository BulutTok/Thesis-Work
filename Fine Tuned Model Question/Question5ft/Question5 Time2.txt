Summary
The *research project* is more applied, focusing on practical solutions.
The *thesis* involves deeper research, often contributing new insights to the field.
Both require defense presentations but differ in depth and scope.

Choosing between them depends on whether you prefer practical application or academic research, as well as your career goals.
