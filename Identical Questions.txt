Core Curriculum and Prerequisites:
“What are the core courses required for my MScIS program, and do any of them have specific prerequisites I need to complete before enrolling?”

Credit Completion:
“How many credits do I still need to earn in order to complete my degree, and which courses are available to help me reach that total?”

Restricted Credit Hours:
“I noticed that no more than 9 credit hours from courses like CSC 591, MIS 591, CSC 595, MIS 595, CSC 598, and MIS 598 can be applied toward my degree—can you explain how that works?”

Additional Course Options:
“What are my options for fulfilling the additional course requirement, and are there any restrictions—such as specific courses that cannot be used (for example, excluding CSC 594 or MIS 594)?”

Research Project vs. Thesis:
“Can you explain the differences between the research project and thesis options for meeting the research/thesis credit requirement, and what are the key milestones for each?”

Graduation Requirements:
“Beyond completing the required credits, what additional graduation requirements should I be aware of (such as applying to graduate on SeaNet and enrolling in the semester of graduation)?”

GPA Concerns:
“Since I currently do not meet the minimum 3.0 GPA requirement for my major, what strategies or options are available to help me improve my academic standing?”

International Student Enrollment and Visa Compliance:
“As an international student, I’m concerned about maintaining my visa status while managing my academic progress. Could you explain how my course schedule and prerequisites are structured to ensure I remain a full-time student, and what additional steps or documentation might be necessary to meet both academic and immigration requirements?”

Course Repetition:
“If I do not achieve the required grade in a course, is it possible to repeat it, and how would that affect my overall credit count and GPA?”

Course Scheduling and Availability:
“Are there specific scheduling guidelines or typical semester offerings for required courses like Network Programming (CSC 544) and Database Management Systems (MIS 555) that I should plan for?”
